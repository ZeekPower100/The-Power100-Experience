## 🔧 API Endpoints

POST /api/partners/public/apply
Body: {
  ...partnerData,
  "submission_type": "partial",
  "completed_steps": 7
}
```

### 2. Portfolio Update (Step 8)
```bash
POST /api/partners/public/update-portfolio/{partnerId}

## 🗄️ Database Changes
- Added `completed_steps` column (INTEGER, default: 8)
- Status values:
  - `'partial_submission'` - After Step 7
  - `'pending_review'` - After Step 8 completion

## 🎯 Key Features Working
1. ✅ Step 7 creates partial partner profile
2. ✅ Partner ID stored in localStorage for continuity
3. ✅ Team members extracted from Step 2 contacts
4. ✅ Form data restored when returning to Step 8
5. ✅ Portfolio data updates existing partner record
6. ✅ Clear navigation flow with proper redirects

## 🐛 Known Issues/Limitations
- Email sending is simulated (logs to console)
- Delegation token generation is basic (needs production enhancement)
- No actual email templates yet

## 📝 Test HTML File

This file provides buttons to test each API endpoint individually.

## ✅ Verification Complete
The delegation flow is fully implemented and functional. CEOs can now:
1. Submit partner profiles (Steps 1-7)
2. Choose to complete portfolio themselves or delegate
3. Team members can complete Step 8 via delegation link
4. All data properly associates with the original partner profile
