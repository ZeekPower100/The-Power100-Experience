# Podcast Form - Batch 6 Field Analysis
## Fields: host_company, host_bio, format

### Verification Results:

| Field | Database | Public Form | Admin Form | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **host_company** | ✅ VARCHAR(255) | ⚠️ Mapped from submitter_company | ✅ Input field | Needs direct field |
| **host_bio** | ✅ TEXT | ❌ Missing | ✅ In formData only | Need input in both |
| **format** | ✅ VARCHAR(100) | ❌ Missing | ✅ Select dropdown | Need in public |

### Issues Found:
1. host_company is being mapped from submitter_company (line 158) instead of having its own field
2. host_bio has no input field in either form (only in formData)
3. format field missing from public form

### ✅ FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ Added host_company field to public form (lines 693-701)
2. ✅ Added host_bio textarea to public form (lines 704-713)
3. ✅ Added host_bio textarea to admin form (lines 672-681)
4. ✅ Added format dropdown to public form (lines 384-402)
5. ✅ Removed incorrect mapping of host_company from submitter_company
6. ✅ Added all fields to initial state (lines 93-95)
