# Quick Progress Check Commands

Run these commands to quickly check your realignment progress:

## Current Status Check
```bash
# 1. What branch am I on?
git branch --show-current

# 2. Any uncommitted changes?
git status --short

# 3. How far behind/ahead of origin?
git status -sb

# 4. Is backend working with production DB?
cd tpe-backend && npm run dev

# 5. Is frontend connecting properly?
cd tpe-front-end && npm run dev
```

## Quick Health Check
```bash
# Check if production is still working
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://tpx.power100.io

# Check if local backend can connect to production DB
cd tpe-backend
node -e "console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL)" 

# Check current AWS deploy branch
cat .github/workflows/deploy.yml | grep "branches:"
```
