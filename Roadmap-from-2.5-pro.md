Of course. Based on the detailed transcription and the provided documents, I have synthesized all the information to map out a comprehensive project plan for "The Power100 Experience" (TPE).

This plan is designed for maximum efficiency, reliability, and functionality, leveraging modern architecture like workflow automation and specialized AI agents to ensure the system is both powerful today and adaptable for the future.

***

### **Project Plan: The Power100 Experience (TPE) Platform**

#### **1. Executive Summary**

The Power100 Experience (TPE) is a sophisticated, AI-driven platform designed to serve as the definitive growth and trust engine for the home improvement industry. It transcends simple lead generation by creating a full-cycle ecosystem. TPE intelligently qualifies contractors, understands their specific business needs, and pairs them with precisely matched, pre-vetted Strategic Partners.

This project will be executed using a modular, agent-based architecture, orchestrated by a workflow automation platform like **n8n**. This approach, which we can refer to as a Multi-Agent Conversation Platform (MCP), ensures scalability, allows for rapid iteration, and "future-proofs" the system by design. Each component can be updated or replaced independently, preventing monolithic constraints and maximizing efficiency.

#### **2. System Architecture: A Multi-Agent Platform (MCP) Approach**

The core of TPE will be an orchestration engine (n8n) that manages a suite of specialized AI agents and connects to various services via APIs.

*   **Orchestration Layer (n8n):** This will serve as the central nervous system of TPE. It will manage all workflows described in the user journeys, from the initial contractor contact to data processing and reporting. Using a visual workflow builder like n8n allows for rapid development and modification of complex logic without extensive custom code.
*   **Frontend (Web & Mobile App):** A unified interface, likely built on a framework like React/Next.js (for web) and React Native (for mobile), where contractors interact with the TPE Concierge.
*   **AI Agents (Leveraging Google Gemini or similar LLMs):** We will develop distinct AI agents with specific roles:
    *   **Onboarding Agent:** Manages the initial user interaction, information capture (name, URL, etc.), and crucial SMS verification/opt-in.
    *   **Discovery & Matching Agent:** Conducts the conversational deep-dive into a contractor's focus areas, analyzes responses, identifies the primary objective, and executes the proprietary algorithm to match the contractor with the best-fit Partner.
    *   **Data-Gathering Agent:** An automated agent responsible for the quarterly outreach (Call, Text, Email) to our Partners' clients and employees to collect feedback for the PowerConfidence Score. This may utilize advanced voice AI for the call component.
    *   **Concierge Agent:** Handles ongoing support, including opt-in weekly calls and the "Open Line Support" for ad-hoc contractor requests.
*   **Core Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):** Securely stores all data, including contractor profiles, detailed partner profiles, conversation logs, feedback, and journey tracking.
*   **Third-Party APIs:**
    *   **Communications (e.g., Twilio):** For handling all SMS (verification, opt-ins) and programmatic voice calls (Data-Gathering Agent).
    *   **Email (e.g., SendGrid):** For managing automated email sequences, including the crucial demo booking introduction.

#### **3. Core Modules & Features (MVP Launch)**

Based on the "Must-Have Capabilities," the initial build will focus on delivering the complete end-to-end contractor journey.

**Module 1: Conversational AI Interface & Contractor Journey**
*   **Functionality:** Guides a contractor from the initial website/phone interaction through the entire pairing process.
*   **Key Steps:**
    1.  **Entry & Verification:** Contractor provides initial info (name, company, email, phone). The system sends a mandatory verification text. The contractor must reply to opt-in and proceed.
    2.  **Profile Formulation:** The AI agent asks about the "top three focus areas" via checkboxes.
    3.  **Deep-Dive Analysis:** The AI engages in a more profound conversation to understand revenue, team size, and current activities related to the chosen focus areas.
    4.  **Primary Objective Agreement:** The AI presents a summary and suggests a primary focus, seeking the contractor's confirmation (the "trial close").
    5.  **Partner Pairing & Due Diligence:** The system showcases the best-fit partner, including their PowerConfidence Score and other supporting materials hosted within the TPE platform.

**Module 2: Demo Booking System**
*   **Functionality:** Seamlessly books a demonstration between the contractor and the matched Partner.
*   **Key Steps:**
    1.  **Automated Email Introduction:** Triggered by the AI after the contractor agrees to a demo.
    2.  **Email Routing:**
        *   **From:** `concierge@power100.io`
        *   **To:** The Partner (via a controlled subdomain like `partner@power100.io` for tracking and automation).
        *   **CC:** The Contractor.
        *   **BCC:** Power100's internal booking/tracking system.
    3.  **Cadence Handoff:** This email automatically kicks off the Partner's pre-meeting cadence. If one doesn't exist, TPE provides a default, pre-built cadence.

**Module 3: Foundational Data Engine**
*   **Functionality:** The system for collecting and managing the data that powers the entire experience.
*   **Key Steps:**
    1.  **Partner Profile Onboarding:** A comprehensive backend interface for Partners to submit their value propositions, pricing, ideal customer profile, and other data points required for the matching algorithm.
    2.  **Client/Employee Data Ingestion:** A secure process for Partners to provide the contact lists for their clients and employees for the quarterly outreach. This includes managing opt-in consent.

**Module 4: Quarterly Report Generator (Initial Version)**
*   **Functionality:** Generates the report that provides value back to the Partners.
*   **Key Steps:**
    1.  **Data Aggregation:** Pulls feedback data collected by the Data-Gathering Agent.
    2.  **Insight Generation:** Processes the data to create distinct sections:
        *   **Positive (Public):** Highlights wins and testimonials.
        *   **Negative (Private):** Provides confidential, constructive feedback and trendlines for leadership.
