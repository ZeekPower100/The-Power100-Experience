# The Power100 Experience (TPE) - Full-Stack Project Context

## üî¥ AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS FOR CLAUDE - DATABASE CONNECTIONS
When you see these keywords, use these SPECIFIC tools:

**LOCAL DATABASE** (keywords: "check local database", "query local", "local table", "dev database"):
‚Üí Use: `powershell -Command ".\quick-db.bat \"YOUR SQL HERE\""`

**PRODUCTION DATABASE** (keywords: "production database", "prod database", "check prod"):
‚Üí Use: `mcp__aws-production__exec` with command:
```
PGPASSWORD='dBP0wer100!!' psql -h tpe-database-production.cmtcsi0kytrf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U tpeadmin -d tpedb -c "YOUR SQL HERE"
```

**NEVER MIX THESE UP!** Local uses batch file, Production uses MCP tool.

## üß™ AI CONCIERGE TESTING - CRITICAL COMMANDS
**ALWAYS USE THESE WHEN TESTING AI FEATURES:**

### Force Refresh Schema (After ANY Database Changes)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-concierge/schema/refresh
```
**Use after:** Adding columns, processing AI data, updating differentiators

### Check What AI Can See
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ai-concierge/schema/summary | jq
```

### Development Auto-Refresh
- Cache: **5 minutes** (vs 24 hours in production)
- New columns: **Automatically discovered**
- AI fields: **Automatically included**

**See `docs/AI-CONCIERGE-TESTING-GUIDE.md` for complete testing guide**

## üîå IMPORTANT: PORT CONFIGURATION
**PRODUCTION PORTS:**
- Frontend: **3000** (Next.js on https://tpx.power100.io)
- Backend: **5000** (Express.js API)

**LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PORTS:**
- Frontend: **3002** (Next.js on http://localhost:3002)
- Backend: **5000** (Express.js API on http://localhost:5000)

## üî¥ CRITICAL: DATABASE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH
**MANDATORY READING: `DATABASE-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`**

Before ANY data-related development:
1. **ALWAYS check database schema FIRST** using `check_table_schema.bat [table]`
2. **Build backend to match database columns EXACTLY**
3. **Build frontend to send correct field names**
4. **Never assume field names - VERIFY in database**

Helper scripts available:
- `check_table_schema.bat` - View exact column names and types
- `check_field_exists.bat` - Verify a specific field exists
- `list_array_fields.bat` - List all array/JSON fields

## ü§ñ AI FIELD NAMING FOR AUTOMATIC CONCIERGE ACCESS
**MANDATORY READING: `docs/AI-FIELD-NAMING-CONVENTIONS.md`**

**Golden Rule:** If it starts with `ai_`, it's automatically in the AI Concierge!

When adding ANY AI-processed field to the database:
1. **Follow naming convention**: `ai_summary`, `ai_insights`, `ai_tags`, etc.
2. **Use correct data types**: TEXT for summaries, JSONB for arrays
3. **No code changes needed**: Fields are auto-discovered and formatted
4. **Test immediately**: Force schema refresh and test in AI Concierge

See `docs/AI-FIELD-NAMING-CONVENTIONS.md` for complete patterns and examples.

## üö® CRITICAL: JSON & STORAGE HANDLING
**MANDATORY READING: `docs/STORAGE-AND-JSON-GUIDELINES.md`**

**NEVER use raw JSON methods or localStorage directly!**
1. **ALWAYS use safe JSON helpers** (`safeJsonParse`, `safeJsonStringify`)
2. **ALWAYS use storage helpers** (`getFromStorage`, `setToStorage`)
3. **NEVER double-stringify** data before storage
4. **FOLLOW naming conventions** for tokens, IDs, and timestamps

Critical documents:
- `docs/STORAGE-AND-JSON-GUIDELINES.md` - Complete development patterns
- `JSON-MIGRATION-SPECIAL-CASES.md` - Edge cases and solutions
- `JSON-MIGRATION-SYNTAX-GUIDE.md` - Backend vs Frontend syntax

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: DATABASE CONFIGURATION
**BOTH Development AND Production use PostgreSQL** 

### üî¥ CRITICAL: BEFORE ANY DATABASE OPERATION
**ALWAYS CHECK FIRST**: `DATABASE-CONNECTION-PATTERN.md`
- **Location**: `C:\Users\broac\CascadeProjects\The-Power100-Experience\DATABASE-CONNECTION-PATTERN.md`
- **NEVER** attempt database connection without checking this file
- **ALWAYS** use the batch file pattern documented there
- If you forget how to connect, CHECK `DATABASE-CONNECTION-PATTERN.md`

### LOCAL DEVELOPMENT Database
- **Host**: localhost
- **Database**: tpedb  
- **User**: postgres
- **Password**: TPXP0stgres!!
- **Port**: 5432
- **Connection Pattern**: See `DATABASE-CONNECTION-PATTERN.md` for EXACT steps

- **Database**: tpedb
- **User**: tpeadmin  
- **Password**: dBP0wer100!!
- **Port**: 5432
- **SSL Required**: Yes

**SQLite is NOT used** - USE_SQLITE=false in all environments

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

The Power100 Experience is a comprehensive full-stack web application that operates in two primary modes:

### 1. **Entry Point: AI-Driven Matching System**
For new contractors entering TPX, the platform guides them through a personalized experience to identify business goals and connects them with verified partners through our intelligent matching algorithm. This is their first interaction with TPX - a structured flow that captures their needs and makes strategic connections.

### 2. **Evolution: AI-First Concierge Platform**
Once contractors are in the TPX ecosystem (post-contractor flow or as partner clients), they gain access to an AI concierge that serves as their always-available business advisor. This AI knows their business intimately, provides contextual guidance across all resources (partners, books, podcasts, events), and anticipates their needs before they arise.

### ü§ñ AI-First Development Principle
**CRITICAL**: While maintaining our core matching system, all new features and data collection must be designed with AI processing in mind. See [AI-First Strategy Document](docs/AI-FIRST-STRATEGY.md) for complete vision. Every data field collected should enable both:
- Immediate value through our matching algorithm
- Future value through AI concierge capabilities and backend intelligence

3. **Business Profiling**: Revenue, team size, readiness indicators
4. **Partner Matching**: AI algorithm matches with approved partners
5. **Completion**: Demo booking and email introduction (See `docs/PARTNER-BOOKING-SYSTEM-GHL-IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

### Admin Dashboard
- Contractor management and analytics
- Partner management with PowerConfidence scoring
- Demo booking oversight
- Pipeline progress tracking

### Partner Integration
- Extensive partner profiles and value propositions
- PowerConfidence scoring from quarterly customer calls
- Automated email introductions via subdomain routing

## üé® Brand Guidelines

### Colors (CSS Variables)
- `--power100-red`: #FB0401 (Primary brand)
- `--power100-green`: #28a745 (Success/CTA)
- `--power100-black`: #000000 (Text)
- `--power100-white`: #ffffff (Backgrounds)
- `--power100-grey`: #6c757d (Secondary text)
- `--power100-bg-grey`: #f8f9fa (Page backgrounds)

### Components
- Using shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Badge)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### UI Component Standards

#### Dropdown Menus (Select Components)
**IMPORTANT**: All dropdown menus must have solid white backgrounds for visibility and consistency.

```tsx
// Standard dropdown implementation:
<Select value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
  <SelectTrigger className="... bg-white">  {/* Always include bg-white */}
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select option" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent className="bg-white">      {/* Always include bg-white */}
    <SelectItem value="option1">Option 1</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="option2">Option 2</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

**Rationale**: Transparent or semi-transparent dropdowns are difficult to read and create accessibility issues. Solid white backgrounds ensure:
- Clear visibility of all options
- Consistent user experience across the platform
- Better contrast for readability
- Professional appearance

## üéØ Standard Card Design System

### **REQUIRED: All cards and forms must follow this consistent design pattern**

#### Container Layout
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-power100-bg-grey flex items-center justify-center">
  <div className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4">
    {/* Card content here */}
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Card Structure
```tsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-lg p-8">
  {/* Red/Green Icon at top center */}
  <div className="flex justify-center mb-6">
    <div className="w-12 h-12 bg-power100-red rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
      <IconComponent className="h-6 w-6 text-white" />
    </div>
  </div>
  
  {/* Content */}
  <div className="text-center">
    {/* Main content here */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Navigation Buttons */}
  <div className="flex gap-4 mt-8">
    {/* Back Button (if needed) */}
    <Button
      variant="outline"
      className="flex-1 bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 text-power100-black hover:bg-gray-50"
    >
      Back
    </Button>
    
    {/* Primary Action Button */}
    <Button className="flex-1 bg-power100-green hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-semibold">
      Continue
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Design Specifications
- **Background**: Light gray (`bg-power100-bg-grey`)
- **Card**: White background with rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`) and shadow (`shadow-lg`)
- **Icon**: 48px circle with Power100 red/green background at top center
- **Buttons**: 
  - Primary: Green background (`bg-power100-green`) with white text
  - Secondary: White background with gray border
- **Spacing**: 32px padding (`p-8`) inside cards
- **Layout**: Centered with max width of 2xl (672px)

#### Examples in Codebase
- ‚úÖ Contractor Flow: `src/app/contractorflow/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Power Cards Survey: `src/components/powerCards/PowerCardSurvey.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Survey Complete: `src/components/powerCards/SurveyComplete.tsx`

## üîÑ Development Workflow Requirements

### üõ°Ô∏è MANDATORY: Start Development with Error Prevention
**ALWAYS start your development session with:**
```bash
npm run safe
```
This provides automatic error prevention that catches JSON and array rendering errors in real-time as you code.

### Git Strategy
- **NEVER work on main/master branch**
- Always create feature branches: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Use conventional commit messages
- Require testing before merging

### Testing Requirements
- Test-driven development approach
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for contractor flow
- E2E tests for critical paths

### Code Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- **ALWAYS use error prevention helpers**: `safeJsonParse()` and `SafeList` components

## üö® Critical Business Logic

### Contractor Verification
- Phone verification via SMS is REQUIRED
- Creates opt-in for AI coaching communications
- Stores verification status in contractor profile

### Focus Area Matching Algorithm
- Maps contractor focus areas to partner capabilities
- Considers revenue tier and team size
- Generates confidence scoring for matches

### Partner Communication Flow
1. Demo booking through TPE interface
2. Email introduction (Power100 ‚Üí Partner subdomain)
3. Automatic response triggers accounting/booking team CC
4. Partner takes over with their cadence

**üìö Implementation Details**: See `docs/PARTNER-BOOKING-SYSTEM-GHL-IMPLEMENTATION.md` for the complete Go High Level + n8n orchestration system that handles email automation, booking confirmation, follow-ups, and performance tracking.

## üö® CRITICAL: DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY Before ANY Production Deployment
**NEVER assume code is fixed. ALWAYS verify with these exact steps:**

#### 1. **Compare Files FIRST**
```bash
# ALWAYS compare dev vs prod files before claiming alignment:
diff tpe-backend/src/services/file.js production/file.js
# Or check specific problem areas:
grep -n "problematic_code" both_files
```

#### 2. **Test Actual API Responses**
```bash
# Don't just check status codes, verify the actual data:
curl -s https://tpx.power100.io/api/endpoint | jq '.specific.field'
# Compare with development:
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/endpoint | jq '.specific.field'
```

#### 3. **Check Error Logs**
```bash
# Production logs:
pm2 logs tpe-backend --lines 20 --nostream | grep -i error
# Development logs:
tail -50 tpe-backend/server.log | grep -i error
```

#### 4. **Verify Both Environments**
- ‚úÖ Development backend code (cat/grep the actual file)
- ‚úÖ Production backend code (cat/grep the actual file)  
- ‚úÖ Development frontend code (cat/grep the actual file)
- ‚úÖ Production frontend code (cat/grep the actual file)
- ‚úÖ Test development API response
- ‚úÖ Test production API response

#### 5. **Track Changes Properly**
- Use TodoWrite to track deployment steps
- Document which environment has which fix
- NEVER mark as "completed" without verification
- If you say "deployed", show the proof

#### 6. **Common Mistake Patterns to Avoid**
- ‚ùå "The production backend was fixed" (assumption)
- ‚úÖ "I verified production has the fix by checking line 42: [show code]"
- ‚ùå "It should be working now"
- ‚úÖ "Confirmed working: API returns success:true with no errors"
- ‚ùå "Frontend fix will solve this"
- ‚úÖ "Backend sends error, fixing backend first at line X"

#### 7. **Understand Error Origins**
- "Unexpected token B in JSON" = Backend parsing issue, NOT frontend
- "Failed to fetch" = Backend not running or CORS issue
- 400 errors = Validation failure (check both frontend AND backend validation)
- 500 errors = Backend code error (check logs immediately)

## üéõÔ∏è Special Instructions for Claude Code

### Always Do
- Create new branch for ANY code changes
- Write tests before implementing features  
- Follow component-based architecture
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Use existing design system and colors
- Implement responsive design
- Add proper error handling
- Include loading states
- **USE safe JSON helpers** (`safeJsonParse`, `safeJsonStringify`)
- **USE storage helpers** (`getFromStorage`, `setToStorage`)
- **READ `docs/STORAGE-AND-JSON-GUIDELINES.md`** before handling any data

### Never Do
- Work directly on main/master branch
- Delete existing code without backup
- Break existing functionality
- Ignore TypeScript errors
- Hardcode values that should be configurable
- Skip accessibility considerations
- **USE raw `JSON.parse()` or `JSON.stringify()`**
- **USE `localStorage` directly**
- **DOUBLE-STRINGIFY data** (calling stringify before setToStorage)

### When Making Changes
1. Analyze impact on contractor flow
2. Consider partner integration effects  
3. Test responsive behavior
4. Verify brand consistency
5. Check TypeScript compilation
6. Run existing tests
7. Create new tests as needed

## ü§ñ System Auto Manager - IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATION: Field Alignment Not Checked
**The System Auto Manager checks file existence but NOT field name alignment!**
Always run `database-field-validator.js` separately to ensure field names match across layers.

### Always Start Development With System Protection
**CRITICAL**: When starting development for the day, ALWAYS run BOTH:
1. **System Auto Manager** - For file completeness
2. **Database Field Validator** - For field alignment

#### Starting Development (Two Options):

**Option 1 - If servers already running:**
```bash
npm run system:watch
```

**Option 2 - Fresh start with everything:**
```bash
npm run dev:with-watch
```
This starts both dev servers AND the system watcher together.

### What the System Auto Manager Does:
- **Automatically detects** when you're adding new entities (controllers, routes, types, forms)
- **Checks completeness** of all required files for each entity
- **Prompts to auto-generate** missing files with proper content
- **Updates existing files** (server.js, api.ts, matching services) automatically
- **Ensures nothing is missed** when adding new components to the system

### Available Commands:
- `npm run system:watch` - Run in watch mode (recommended during development)
- `npm run system:check` - One-time system integrity check
- `npm run system:add webinar` - Manually add a complete new entity
- `npm run dev:with-watch` - Start everything together

### How It Works:
1. When you create ANY entity file (e.g., `webinarController.js`), the system detects it
2. Within 3 seconds, it checks what's missing
3. Prompts: "Would you like to auto-generate missing files? (y/n)"
4. If yes, creates all required files with proper boilerplate
5. Prompts: "Would you like to auto-update existing files? (y/n)"
6. If yes, updates server.js, api.ts, and all connection points

### Example Protected Workflow:
```bash
# Start your day
npm run dev:with-watch  # Or npm run system:watch if servers are running

# Create a new controller
touch tpe-backend/src/controllers/webinarController.js

# System detects and prompts:
# "Entity 'webinar' is incomplete! Auto-generate missing files? (y/n)"
# Type 'y'

# System creates:
# - webinarRoutes.js
# - webinar.ts (types)
# - WebinarForm.tsx
# - Admin page
# - Updates server.js, api.ts, matching services

# You're fully protected and can focus on business logic!
```

**Never develop without this safety net - it prevents hours of debugging missing connections!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Server Management - ALWAYS USE dev-manager.js

### CRITICAL: Always Use dev-manager.js for Server Operations
**NEVER use npm scripts directly for server management. ALWAYS use dev-manager.js unless explicitly told otherwise.**

#### Available Commands:
```bash
# Starting servers
node dev-manager.js start all        # Start both frontend and backend
node dev-manager.js start frontend   # Start only frontend
node dev-manager.js start backend    # Start only backend

# Stopping servers
node dev-manager.js stop all         # Stop all servers
node dev-manager.js stop frontend    # Stop only frontend
node dev-manager.js stop backend     # Stop only backend

# Restarting servers
node dev-manager.js restart all      # Restart both servers
node dev-manager.js restart frontend # Restart only frontend
node dev-manager.js restart backend  # Restart only backend

# Status check
node dev-manager.js status           # Check status of all servers

# Clean build artifacts
node dev-manager.js clean            # Clean build folders
```

#### Why dev-manager.js?
- Handles Windows-specific process management correctly
- Properly kills processes using the correct PID
- Manages port conflicts automatically
- Provides graceful shutdown and restart
- Ensures clean build artifacts
- Prevents orphaned processes

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# When backend code changes are made:
node dev-manager.js restart backend

# When starting development for the day:
node dev-manager.js start all

# When fixing port conflicts:
node dev-manager.js restart all
```

**DO NOT USE:**
- ‚ùå `npm run backend:restart`
- ‚ùå `npm run dev`
- ‚ùå `npm start`
- ‚ùå Direct `taskkill` commands
- ‚ùå Manual process killing

**ALWAYS USE:**
- ‚úÖ `node dev-manager.js` for ALL server operations

### üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always Start Development with Error Prevention

**MANDATORY**: When starting development, ALWAYS use:
```bash
npm run safe
```

This command:
1. Starts frontend and backend servers
2. **Automatically watches for JSON and array rendering errors**
3. **Checks your code in real-time as you save files**
4. **Prevents 90% of runtime errors before they happen**

**DO NOT USE:**
- ‚ùå `npm run dev:start` (no error protection)
- ‚ùå `node dev-manager.js start` (no error protection)
- ‚ùå Starting servers individually

**ALWAYS USE:**
- ‚úÖ `npm run safe` - Start with automatic error prevention
- ‚úÖ `npm run safe:restart` - Restart servers WITH error protection maintained
- ‚úÖ `npm run error:check` - Before any commit

**For Server Maintenance:**
```bash
# When restarting servers (e.g., after backend changes):
npm run safe:restart

# NOT these:
‚ùå node dev-manager.js restart  # No error protection
‚ùå npm run dev:restart          # No error protection
‚ùå Ctrl+C then restart manually # Loses error protection
```

This ensures:
- JSON parsing errors are caught immediately
- React array rendering errors are prevented
- Error protection is maintained during restarts
- You never test broken code
- You never commit errors

See `docs/AUTO-ERROR-PREVENTION.md` for full details.
- whenever you are writing or referring to a current date, always do a web search and check what the current date is.
- never request to do a hard git rest unless it is absolutely necessary. For issues related to unwanted files being staged and committed or anything similar this is never a suitable option because it runs the risk of permenantely losing progressive changes. Uncommitted first, then unstaging is the only via option for these sort of situations. A hard git reset is ony for dire scenarios where losing progressive changes actually carry benefit to the project overall.
- when there is a detection during our checker sequence, even if you feel like it can be bypassedm ALWAYS output an explanation
   of what it is and an "answer in short" response so we understand what the error is about and how to address it. You can then
   suggest to skip it if it makes sense with a via argument for doing so. If I decide we skip it after you plea your case, ONLY
   THEN will we proceed to bypass our checkers. We should NEVER automatically bypass ur checkers. Its sole purpose is to check 
  for issues so I am getting into the habit of going against that.
- We're only doing "Start all" options for the dev-manager.js for the time being when we are restarting the servers. Or more specifically stay away from "restart" because the backend keeps crashing when we use this command
- 13-14 minutes is the average time it takes for auto deployment (via remote git push to master branch) to complete and updates to show in production
