# Book Form Final Fixes - Complete Alignment Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Public Form - Key Citations Label Update
**Fixed:** Changed label from "Key Citations" to "Who are the top people you cite in your book?"
- File: `tpe-front-end/src/components/book/BookOnboardingForm.tsx`
- Line: 583
- Description updated to: "Add the key people you reference and their expertise"

### 2. Admin Form - Strategic Field Name Misalignment
**Problem:** Admin form was using old field names that didn't match database
**Fixed:** Updated field names to match database columns exactly

|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| writing_inspiration | writing_influence | What influenced you to write this book? |
| problems_addressed | intended_solutions | What solutions were you hoping to provide? |
| next_12_18_months | author_next_focus | What are you focused on for next 12-18 months? |
| book_goals | book_goals | âœ… Already correct |
| author_availability | author_availability | âœ… Already correct |

### 3. Admin Form - Missing Submitter Fields

**Fixed:** Added complete submitter information section with:
- submitter_name
