INSTRUCTIONS TO COPY SQLITE DATABASE:

1. On your local Windows machine, find the file:
   C:\Users\broac\CascadeProjects\The-Power100-Experience\tpe-backend\power100.db

2. Upload it to the server using SCP or your preferred method to:
   /home/ubuntu/The-Power100-Experience/tpe-backend/power100.db

3. Then run: node /home/ubuntu/migrate-partners.js

Alternatively, we can manually create the demo partners in PostgreSQL.
