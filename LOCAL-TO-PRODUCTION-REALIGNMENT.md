# Local to Production Realignment Plan
**Created**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Critical**: Complete this before any other development work

## üéØ Objective
Realign local development environment with production AWS deployment, consolidate branches, and establish proper dev-to-production workflow.

## üìä Current State
- **Current AWS Deploy Branch**: `feature/aws-deployment-infrastructure` ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Target AWS Deploy Branch**: `main` 
- **Production URL**: https://tpx.power100.io
- **Production Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS
- **Local Environment**: Windows, needs PostgreSQL connection

## ‚úÖ Progress Tracker

### Phase 1: Assessment & Backup [IN PROGRESS]
- [x] Check current branch status locally
  ```bash
  git branch --show-current
  git status
  git branch -a
  ```
  **Result**: Current branch: `feature/aws-deployment-infrastructure`

- [x] Check for uncommitted changes
  ```bash
  git status
  git diff
  ```
  **Result**: Found uncommitted changes in: CLAUDE.md, matchingstep.tsx, settings files, plus new demo/reports files

- [x] Create safety backup branch
  ```bash
  git checkout feature/aws-deployment-infrastructure
  git pull origin feature/aws-deployment-infrastructure
  git checkout -b backup/pre-realignment-20241226
  git push origin backup/pre-realignment-20241226
  ```
  **Completed**: August 26, 2025 - Branch created and pushed

- [x] Document current AWS deployment configuration
  **Finding**: August 26, 2025 - No GitHub Actions deployment
  - Deployment is manual via CloudFormation + SSH
  - Uses batch files: `DEPLOY-PRODUCTION.bat`
  - Infrastructure created with CloudFormation
  - Code deployed manually via SSH to EC2
  - No automatic CI/CD pipeline exists

### Phase 2: Local Environment Setup [COMPLETED]
- [x] Create backend environment file
  **File**: `tpe-backend/.env.local`
  ```env
  NODE_ENV=development
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tpeadmin:dBP0wer100!!@tpe-database-production.cmtcsi0kytrf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/tpedb
  PORT=5000
  JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-change-in-production-to-something-very-secure
  USE_SQLITE=false
  DB_HOST=tpe-database-production.cmtcsi0kytrf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_NAME=tpedb
  DB_USER=tpeadmin
  DB_PASSWORD=dBP0wer100!!
  ```
  **Created**: August 26, 2025 - Created with production database connection

- [x] Create frontend environment file
  **File**: `tpe-front-end/.env.local`
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
  ```
  **Created**: Already existed, confirmed August 26, 2025

- [x] Test backend connection to production database
  ```bash
  cd tpe-backend
  npm run dev
  ```
  **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Using local PostgreSQL
  **Solution Implemented**: August 26, 2025
  - Installed PostgreSQL 16 locally
  - Created full production backup from RDS
  - Imported production data to local PostgreSQL (17 contractors, 1 partner)
  - Fixed SQL syntax differences (SQLite ? to PostgreSQL $1 placeholders)
  - Fixed column name mismatches (password_hash‚Üípassword, power_confidence_score‚Üípowerconfidence_score)

- [x] Test frontend connection to local backend
  ```bash
  cd tpe-front-end
  npm run dev
  ```
  **Status**: ‚úÖ Working
  **Confirmed**: August 26, 2025 - Frontend compiled successfully, running on port 3002

### Phase 3: Feature Testing Checklist [IN PROGRESS]
Test all critical features locally with production database:

- [ ] **Contractor Flow**
  - [ ] Phone verification (use 123456 bypass)
  - [ ] Focus area selection
  - [ ] Business profiling
  - [ ] Partner matching results display
  - [ ] Completion step
  **Notes**: _[Any issues?]_

- [x] **Admin Dashboard**
  - [x] Login (admin@power100.io / admin123)
  - [x] View contractors (17 production contractors loaded)
  - [x] View partners (1 production partner loaded)

  ```bash
  git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
  git commit -m "fix: Update deployment to use main branch"
