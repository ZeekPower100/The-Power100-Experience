Ongoing AI concierge capabilities doc

Yes - remember the concierge will have access to ALL event database tables so it will know all of the event context for that
  contractor, because the contractor gets a personalized schedule once the complete their event registration and the agenda for   
  the event is confirmed. They get recommended speakers based on their focus areas, recommended sponsors/partners to engage       
  with, recommended peer matching with other contractors who are in non-competing markets as they are. The database will have     
  details on the speakers, the sponsors, and peers from the event so going into more detail on any of these per the contractors   
  request won't be an issue (we could even give the agent web search capabilities for additional enhancement as well).They still  
  should be able to ask the concierge anything they want that helps them reach their goals even while at the event. The
  concierge would just know when to keep heavy event context due to the nature of the question and when it doesn't need it so     
  much. When contractors are not at events then there is no need to consider event context. I hate that I have to keep
  describing what the AI Concierge is to you. We have been building this for nearly 60 days now. You should know all of this.     
  It's all through our project directory. It should be able to take any sort of notes the contractor has during the event (which  
  we want to encourage) and make proper scheduling with certain people based on those notes (if needed). It should categorize     
  things effectively in the database as well during those sort of interactions. It should be able to curate and send emails to    
  (the domain for now will be from a power100 domain until the handoff is complete within the intro of entities involved), text  
  as well, it should be able to contextualize the size and revenue of the contractor's business comparing that to the first       
  party data we receive from other businesses of the same size (from our ongoing quarterly feedback loop of our partner's
  clients) and give them specifics it knows works for other business that is essentially exactly like the contractor's
  business, knows which partners are best based on these data points as well, readjust goals and other data point columns
  specific to that contractor, constantly check in on the progress of things it the concierge and the contractor planned out,     
  schedule requested reminders, create detailed plans that fit their business specifically and based off of real time industry    
  data we constantly collect every quarter and through continued interactions with other businesses similar to the contractor's   
  business, and many other things. It is a tailored home improvement business advisor, a highly intelligent assistant, and just   
  everything. Its everything a contractor needs to reach the next level in their business. Its capabilities will continue to        
  expand as well.
