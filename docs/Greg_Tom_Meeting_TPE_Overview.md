0:00 - Greg Cummings
Definitely feeling good. I mean, this is I would say the best talented team that the Buccaneers have ever had from roster to roster. Yeah, yeah.

0:05 - Thomas D Traub
I'm a big Broncos fan, so hopefully hopefully we do a lot better this year and get past the first round of the playoffs. They got a hell of a team too, so they do, and I think Bo Nix is the real deal. Bo Nix and that defense is oof. We got green law from San Francisco and from San Francisco, so it's gonna there'll be lights out.

0:29 - Greg Cummings
Well, I really hope we see in the Super Bowl.

0:33 - Unidentified Speaker
That'll be fun.

0:34 - Greg Cummings
That will be fun. I'll make it. We mean you will go wherever it is. I don't know where it is this year, but I'm in if they go.

0:46 - Thomas D Traub
Then yeah, that'll definitely. If they're in, then we'll go.

0:50 - Greg Cummings
Alright, that's a deal. Scout's honor. Yeah.

0:53 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

0:54 - Thomas D Traub
Pinky promise. Yeah.

0:55 - Greg Cummings
And then, and then whoever loses has to pay for the other person's ticket.

0:59 - Thomas D Traub
Let's make it interesting. Yeah.

1:01 - Greg Cummings
Because that, you know, those tickets are going to go for.

1:05 - Thomas D Traub
So yeah, I think, I think that's a good, that is a good one. I like that. I like that a lot.

1:12 - Greg Cummings
I might.

1:13 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

1:13 - Greg Cummings
Deal. All right.

1:14 - Greg Cummings
I'm in. Um, so what's been happening in your world, brother?

1:19 - Thomas D Traub
As we talked about last time, it's just manufacturing is an interesting world. It's funny because, you know, watching everybody else and seeing what's happening out there, you know, we've just gone through the numbers this morning with regards to the dealer channel. And surprisingly, a lot of our plants are up, which is good. A lot of our new construction and multifamily, they're sucking wind. So I'm glad to be on the dealer side of the coin.

1:54 - Greg Cummings
Let's just say that. Yeah, I can imagine. I can imagine.

1:59 - Unidentified Speaker
We're seeing the same thing.

2:01 - Greg Cummings
So it's definitely, we're echoing that exact, the same exact thing, man, which is what we're so excited about this year is we just kind of rolled out our Gen 1, our V1, if you will, of our new product for next year, which is so it's called the power 100 experience and what it does is it's going to bring it's going to be a If Amazon and Amazon and Google had a baby, this is what it would be okay, but but yet with the right intention, so right only the best get pushed, the rest, you have to earn your stripes. And so, you know what I'll do? I just presented this crap at the, we just did a mastermind in Fort Lauderdale. What we're doing is we're bringing in manufacturers and dealers, large, large guys, and we're bringing them in for like a little mini AI conference case study It's happening as well as an industry event. So we're taking everything that we're seeing, and we're just making it like a two-day thing. We just did the first one. It was awesome. We had, I can't even remember the name, the roofing project, Da Vinci. We had a couple of executives from Da Vinci meet us in Fort Otterdale. It was me, Paul Burleson, Cody, Ciro was there, Vic's son and Vincent's son from Channel Automation and then Rise, prospectively. So, and then everybody presented. It was two days. We went from 11 to 5 each day, 11am to 5pm. We got dinner and then cigars or whatever later. I can't talk about all that stuff. I can talk about everything else.

4:13 - Thomas D Traub
No, I got that.

4:14 - Greg Cummings
You got to be there to experience the later.

4:18 - Thomas D Traub
I can imagine.

4:19 - Greg Cummings
So what we discussed. So the first day, what I talked about was just State of the Union, kind of everything that we're seeing. We revealed a two-year case study, Thomas. Where I took the commonalities of all the top leaders that we interviewed, that we interacted with, and we put it down into five pillars. And so I presented that. I can share that speech with you here at some time. It was the same speech that I did in Chicago at Pinnacle event. And so, but it was just a little bit, you know, shorter because of the audience. And day two, we went into, okay, what do we do? What does Power 100 actually do? Because the guys at DaVinci, they don't know anything, right? They're corporate manufacturers. They're so far detached from what actually goes on in the house, depending on who they are, right? Most of the time, they just don't know what contractors are dealing with because they have their own problems.

5:25 - Thomas D Traub
Right.

5:26 - Greg Cummings
Do you see stuff like that?

5:28 - Thomas D Traub
Oh, yeah.

5:29 - Thomas D Traub
Yeah. I mean, because we're dealing with some, you know, we're dealing with some of the largest national players window wise. And, you know, they there's attachments there. They try to stay as involved as possible. But I totally understand. Just listen. Right. Right.

5:45 - Greg Cummings
And, you know, it's always from a different perspective as well. That's that's what makes it so powerful. So then we went down. We kind of recapped yesterday what I went over. In my presentation. So the overarching theme of it is brand equals leadership plus culture. And the formula is this because leadership is your ability to see the vision and inspire others to follow or lead your vision. Culture is a test of your leadership, right? And brand is how people know you, what they say when you're not around and what they feel when they walk in your building or a house, right? So that's kind of This is all stuff I'm just kind of skimming over for you. And then basically what we do, and everything is really geared towards the kickoff of 2026. It's really Q4 is when it's going to start, but we create content. Everybody knows that. We coach leadership. We conduct partners. I'm sorry. We connect partners and contractors. We provide real data. We rank leaders and partners. We promote the best. A couple of things on this list are new. A couple are old, creating content. Obviously, I don't think there's anybody that doesn't know that we don't create content by now. This was at Pinnacle. Paul, we followed him around. This is just the sizzler, the trailer. Yeah.

7:20 - Unidentified Speaker
Yo Dave.

7:22 - Greg Cummings
So the legends were up there, huh?

7:32 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

7:33 - Thomas D Traub
Yeah, that was the legends night.

7:41 - Greg Cummings
Paul got inducted into the you know Ring of Honor along with a couple other people and so but we did a whole presentation on just him and interviewed a bunch of people the full production is being released actually this week it's it's a tearjerker man it's awesome moving through it we coach leadership we coach leadership on our next 100 calls these meetings are twice a week they rotate between four topics, sales, marketing, operations, and customer experience. The idea here is to allow contractors under $25 million to get on and hear and learn from the best of the best. The structure is we have one CEO that is in the business and we have two partners that talk about the business from an aggregated data standpoint, meaning they have hundreds of clients. So, what are they seeing as a commonality across their platform that aligns with the topic at hand, right? And so it goes sales, marketing, operations, customer experience. This has been going on for a while now. It is incredible. Really, this is something really special, but this is something like, so from your perspective, from a manufacturing perspective, this would be big to offer all your clients because your contractors need a little nudge but they also don't need somebody to tell them what the fuck to do. Right? So the idea here is to get them thinking, get them seeing what's possible, thinking what they could do. And then if they're the right person, Thomas, they just run with that, man. Like they don't need to be baby. These are tough, strong, very passionate people. And so we want to give them that, that freedom to move with how and then if you miss a call, you have access to the whole database through what's called a member portal. So you log in with your credentials and you can see all past appointments. I'm sorry, past meetings. I'll show you that here in a second, okay? That portal. But this is something that going out to contractors under 25 million, guaranteed it will change the trajectory of their company over the course of that year, right? There's going to be a major thing that's going to hit home with them that's going to help them dramatically. And obviously, if we help each contractor dramatically, it helps their purchasing power, right?

10:22 - Thomas D Traub
Yeah. It's what everybody always asks for, but they bring in outside consultants. And now you've got industry people to help provide coaching in a way that you're not going to find from someone that's no third party that doesn't understand the industry. So yeah, I love it.

10:39 - Greg Cummings
And they're not in it for a greediness like consultant, even if it is 100% industry consultant, they're not going to give you what you want until you start coughing up the money, right? Correct.

10:53 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

10:53 - Greg Cummings
And it's just the kind of it. So I think you see it, we can move past it. We connect the right partners, so we're taking it a step further. Exactly in line with what we were just talking about, they're not going to get sold something on those calls. However, if they need something, we can be there. The Power 100 experience will provide that in a non-salesy way that genuinely puts them in the best position to succeed based off their business. This experience We get a high-level tech stack, high-level service area and service offerings, and then employee count, revenue count, just to kind of understand who they are, and then what their current focus areas are. And I'll show you this here in a second as well, once I get off the presentation. Then we provide real data. We collect data directly from contractors and partners. In a hundred percent confidential manner. So then we take all that data and we aggregate it back to the industry for real-time reporting. So similar how I'm reporting on our two-year case study on what works and what doesn't work essentially, we are now going to have a quarterly report where people are going to be able to get on and they're going to be able to hear this kind of unveiling if you what's going on in the industry specific. This is where it separates from everything. There is not one good data point in this industry. There's not one because everything is skewed by these, by a private equity group or a large, there's no apples to apples comparison. And even if there was an apples to apples comparison, you know, this as well as I do, Thomas is company a tracks, closing percentages, even like, all one way, right? Where company two tracks, what an actual appointment was, what goes into that? What is a lead? What is a, what is considered set? Like everybody wants to look good when they, when they share their numbers, right? So when, when they know it's going to be them, they're going to, when there's transparency on it, right? But when you take the a hundred percent confidentiality approach, they are now in it. To get better because they now know that if they're able to be, you know, honest about it, then other people are as well. And then when they get the data back, they know where they stand.

13:33 - Thomas D Traub
So are you meet across those variables? Are you, are you getting a mean line to the aggregate with whatever data you're getting?

13:41 - Greg Cummings
And then you could, you could, but really where my lies with this is by the variance. So, I don't give a **** what you're closing. If I'm a if I'm a contractor, which I I've been in the spot where I've sat in a chair with my head down and goes, man, I wonder what everyone else is closing at. Like, is it just us right now? Like, I I've had that so many times. No, it's the number one question. I wish I could wish to admit. If I if if we had one of our guys calling us the first thing you'd ask him is it's the overall it's the overreaching global question what do you see out there this is this is what I this is the answer to that question what do you see out yeah and so the what are you closing at really means are you guys up or down yeah and so what we're going to report is the variance because of that example I said earlier tom where you are company a and I'm company b we might have some differentiating ways to track our KPIs, okay? Because of whatever reason. I personally think if I issue you a lead and they slam the door on your face, that counts against your closing percentage. But you might be more of an old school guy that says, no, if you don't pitch it, it's not in there. If it's a one legger, it's not in there, right? And so it's different. But you, company A, Thomas, are going to consistently manage your business the same way this month as you do next month. And so am I. So all that I'm really concerned about is what is your variance? Meaning, are you up 5% or are you down 10%, right? And so if I can have that understanding, then I can relate it to my business. Because if you just say a percentage, it's just like all other data that's out there.

15:39 - Thomas D Traub
Yeah, but is the aggregate, so the aggregate is across, I'm just thinking of the selling points, the aggregate across is an aggregate across the country because of the people that you put into this program.

15:53 - Greg Cummings
It's not regional. It's one step further than that. So let's say you're a $30 million company. Yep. You're going to only see the variance from 30 million, like from, let's say, 25 to $35 million companies, you're only going to see the people that are in your wheelhouse. You're no longer going to have skewed data of Leaf Home coming in and saying they're closing at 62% when really their average ticket is 3,500 on gutter guards, right?

16:26 - Thomas D Traub
Yeah, because if you take a window roll, the window nation of Mad City, the castle, you take the big boys, the guys we deal with, they would skew everything across the board.

16:42 - Greg Cummings
But they also want the data themselves. So we don't wanna skew the data on their side either. So when they come in, they are gonna see the data only that's pertinent to their arena. Does that make sense?

17:00 - Thomas D Traub
Oh, I think it's fantastic. Why wouldn't they buy in? I'm trying to make it a no-brainer here. To me, it is a no-brainer because that's the part that, you know, it is all about data and the guys that are doing it well at high volumes, multi-facility, national presence, think they have all the KPIs down to a science because they're pitching to the next equity deal. They're scaling to the next equity deal. They're trying to grow so that they get the next EBITDA call it 12 times. But this is the point that I don't think they have what they think are their data points. They don't have the aggregate across the board, which is a huge deal. And it's still fair because to your if if there is extreme confidentiality to it and that's the part that's gonna be have to hit hard cuz you know how all these guys are. It's it's my pond.

18:09 - Greg Cummings
Don't swim in it.

18:11 - Thomas D Traub
Just don't swim in it. So, yeah.

18:14 - Greg Cummings
No, I think it's awesome. Yeah, we're not gonna have the buy-in from the guys that you named, okay?

18:21 - Thomas D Traub
No, you're not.

18:22 - Greg Cummings
Those those are not who we're interested in. Like as a whole because they have they have a version of what I'm offering already. Okay, correct, but but the guys that you know CBB has three different besides the Aperture side.

18:38 - Thomas D Traub
We have the services side. We have the commercial side, but there are so many accounts within our system because I see we call it a BI report and we I know I can look all of that. If you look at, if your point is 30 million and anything under that, the amount of counts that this could apply to across the board. So are you keeping it specific to anything building products or you could be keeping it to any specific product? How's that going to work?

19:14 - Greg Cummings
Yeah, it's a great question.

19:16 - Greg Cummings
So I'm going to get to that. Let me get off this deck and get into the web to show you a little bit more, to kind of put some picture to these words. So the data is here, right? 100% confidential. I'll show you how we do that in a second. And then as a result, we rank people, but how we actually acquire the data is on power cards. They're quarterly power cards. So let's, I mean, we can use as an example, but really the real launch product is partners. So RILA, CERO, whatever partner that is trying to sell into Home Improvement. Every one of their employees and every one of their clients gets a power card each quarter. And so you hit the nail on the head, there's two major elephants in the room when I I was building this. Why would a partner give me all their clients? And why would they give me all their employees as well? Those are the two things that, to what you said earlier, it's my pun. I like you, bro, but can you just get the heck out? Go away. This industry has benefited plagued by the paranoia salesperson right paranoia account. This is mine not yours like that's kind of what makes it great, but it's also kind of holding it back a little bit. So we want to bridge that really what we want to do. So we go under 100% confidential agreements with them. They give us necessarily the CEO's point of contact on their client side or for you it'd be your contractor side. It would be the CEO or it might be whoever is in charge of your product. Whoever has the ability to make your product a success in their business. That's who receives the power card. It's not necessarily the most powerful person in the company. It's whoever is actually in charge of And so and and also in charge of your metrics, so you get three metrics to to kind of Customize your power card by and that's what the questions will revolve around Okay, and that's what your your kpis are going to revolve around. That's what your dashboard is going to revolve around That's what all of your content that we create on behalf of your success is going to happen and then the client I'm sorry, the employees, they also will get, it'll be more of a standard card because we want to hear about culture, belief, right? We want to hear about that side of your business because we believe if your customers are happy and your employees are happy, then you are a good fit for the next prospect, whether that prospect is a new hire employee or a new client.

22:28 - Unidentified Speaker
Makes sense?

22:29 - Greg Cummings
Makes, yeah. Love it. We bring everything together through our proprietor, ranking system and we give that company a power confidence rating or now known as a PCR. Then from there, we'll take the top companies within the system I'm going to show you and we're going to promote it. We're going to send out mailers to all the home improvement companies. Okay, so if they need a new manufacturer of windows or siding or roofing, they can go through that on their focus area, and then you'll be pinged as a top solution for them. And I'll show you all this in a second. Our mission is to be the single most trusted resource for the home improvement industry. And that's what we're out to do, man. It's never us.

23:16 - Greg Cummings
It's always our partner.

23:17 - Unidentified Speaker
Yep.

23:17 - Greg Cummings
Let me show you the digs here. You might like it. How are you doing on time?

23:23 - Thomas D Traub
I'm good. No, no worries. I'm good. I'm good. I don't go on vacation till Tuesday, so.

23:29 - Greg Cummings
I got a three o'clock, so I'm I'm good as well.

23:33 - Thomas D Traub
Because what I want to do is before I go, I'm going to have a discussion with our executive VP and then I want to get you scheduled with a call with him so that we can get this shit going on our side. We've got it. We've got too much too much. I was just I was just with long home products down in uh South Florida working them through EAS um on the but there's so many individual guys like him that are you know, John DePorte that uh Matt was in from his company.

24:09 - Greg Cummings
He's on your list.

24:10 - Greg Cummings
John. Yeah. John. Yeah. John, Johnny, all those guys, Adam. I know them all. Yeah. Uh great group. Bo's effort. Um awesome. Awesome little So golf tournament they got, it's actually big now. No, they're fantastic. But that's who we want to cater to, Thomas, is the independently owned and operated, privately held companies. We don't want to go to the franchises. We don't want to go to the big box guys. We don't want to go to Lowe's, Home Depot. We don't want private equity run companies. If you go raise some VC money, cool. But we want to rank and support companies that have a leader that doesn't have somebody to answer to, right? Where they don't have to make the decision this quarter to chop 15 people just because they have to show projected profits. Correct. That's the dirty, dirty, dirty world we're living in this second, right? Private equity, it's got its place, it's rewarded a lot of great people that built great businesses. But if private equity doesn't figure shit out, they're not going to be able to hire anybody. And people that they are going to be able to hire are not from the industry. If they're not from the industry, they're not going to understand the business. If they're not understanding the business, there's going to be kind of this water slide effect of losing management. I mean, losing market share. And if you lose market share, they're going to then pull the trigger and sell. The good news is they're still going to make a shitload of money, but they're not going to make as much as they thought they would. And now where do all these companies land? That's one scenario. The other scenario is they figure it out and they buy up everybody. That's the other scenario.

26:09 - Unidentified Speaker
Yep.

26:10 - Thomas D Traub
I'm familiar with it. Both scenarios, all of it.

26:14 - Greg Cummings
So, you know, we are already seeing massive players like BlackRock getting involved. I mean, so we want to support the locally owned, independently owned and operated, you know, 500 million and below. Next 100, what I mentioned earlier, that is specifically for under 25 million coaches. But that's just the language. I have guys that are 150 million that are getting on it because the people speaking, they're like, oh shit, I've seen him at a conference. I've talked to him. Those guys are the ones that actually want to get on the calls because they're like, no, I know how good that guy is. Where the small guys, dude, they don't have time to take a dump because they're running around their head on fire. Do you know what I mean? So nevermind understanding the quality of people that we're putting on. That's the challenge, right? It's saying, hey guys, look, you don't understand what you have in front of you. You have people that have been there, done that in the same fields, arenas with the same management, the same thought process as you. And they're three levels up from where you are. And they're getting ready to tell you why they love this industry and what it's given them and what's working right now.

27:32 - Thomas D Traub
Our call was, before all this, was about AI and the implementation internally, more on an operations aspect of what guys are using AI for. But this is awesome. So you're utilizing, it says AI driven, so I'm- Yeah, look at this.

27:50 - Greg Cummings
So you can interact with our platform two ways. One, what you're used to, right? Ask anything. You can also text this. There's a phone number that your complete Home Improvement AI system is a saved phone number in your phone. At any point, you go to it like a buddy and text it and it knows you, right? You can text it every freaking morning and it could tell you, hey, what's the best news that we've seen? I don't even care what the cost is.

28:20 - Thomas D Traub
The guy would be stupid not to get into this. You know what I mean, Greg? You know what I mean?

28:26 - Greg Cummings
I'm just creating what I would want and I'm trying to make it. Again, our mission is to be the most trusted point in the industry. We're not going outside our industry, we're staying with where we are. This is going to change from AI coach to AI concierge because the word coach, in my opinion, is overused. Here's where we have it right. This is the demo. Mentioned AI, so I just wanted to, you know, that we have it on here. I just wanted to show you that. So, there's an onboarding process that your contractors will go through. And then, once they go through the quick onboarding process, again, it's probably five minutes itself. They then can take the Concierge, the Power 100 experience is what we're calling it, right? So, we come in here, they fill out their stuff, Boom. Tax verification sent. It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This is a demo. Then we take a look. This is where, and this is what DaVinci went nuts on. I was like, you have, you send this out, it's free for, it's literally free. This is completely free to have for your, for the contractors to have an account. Okay. They're already paying $20 a month for chat GPT, right? Or $30 a month for chat GPT and they just write emails with it. Well, you can now write emails on ours and it's a closed loop. You're no longer giving your data to Microsoft or some big box or whoever it is. You're keeping it within the ecosystem of home improvement. Really our underlining target is to replace Google for home improvement search. And it's easy to do because Google's, it doesn't hold any weight. All it is is a phone book. Now you have to, okay. If you don't have good reviews, you're not even in the game. Right. Yeah. But what we're going to do is remove and every day it'll be like, it'll be like Tuesday morning during the NFL season.

30:39 - Unidentified Speaker
What happens every Tuesday?

30:41 - Thomas D Traub
New power rankings come out. Right.

30:43 - Thomas D Traub
Wow. Yeah. What? No, usually a Monday night game, usually a hangover, but that's it. You gotta pay your bookie every Tuesday.

30:54 - Greg Cummings
So, but to your point, like, so after the games are played, we now have a power ranking score. So Tampa Bay moved up three spots because they just knocked off the Rams, right? In a convincing win. And so these partners or the manufacturers will have that same up and down effect each quarter. And then once you get a couple of quarters under your belt, now you're able to track historical data like the freaking stock market, okay? How good is this company over a period of time? So let's say that I'm the contractor, I'm your contractor, let's just say, I want to grow Greenfield. I want more leads. I want to optimize my leads and I want to hire sales leadership. Let's just say those are my three focus areas. If you saw here, up to three over the next 12 to 18 months. I hit continue to go through this. Let's just say I'm back home in Tampa. Let's say my revenue is 21 to 30 million. Let's say I got 30 employees. I'm a roofing, window, and siding. Now I'm in Florida, so I'm not going to do siding because only like 1% of people do siding in Florida. So let's just say I'm a roofing, windows, and doors company. Now in my onboarding, Thomas, I would have already told them what my tech stack was for sales, marketing, operations, and customer experience. Really a fast process there. Then from here, it says for your selected focus areas, have you recently increased tools or technology? Have you added new team members or dedicated resources? Have you increased activity or initiatives in these areas? Let's just say, for Greenfield, I hired a couple of new sales reps in that area, but we haven't really figured much out. That's what this is telling me. How serious are your focus areas, right? So we go here and we say, this is not going to be AI coaching. This is just going to be access to your concierge. And your concierge will text you every week based on what you've said you want to do. It's just a little nudge. It'll say, Hey, Thomas, you said you wanted to grow Greenfield and hire a new sales manager. Have you done that yet? No. Okay. What's going on? Well, I talked to three people last week I hated them all you want help finding somebody yes okay now we can recommend another partner that will actually help them and then we can transfer we could actually get to a point where we are taking all the information of what they're looking for and literally have that an email form to a partner saying this is what I need this is what I'm dealing with here's the area and it's literally from everything from a **** text message.

34:00 - Unidentified Speaker
I love it.

34:02 - Greg Cummings
So, we go here, find my match. So, we're up here. It says we found your perfect matches. Um now, remember, we're an all-encompassing platform, okay? Like, it's not just one thing or another. Um Greenfield Growth is your primary focused area based off what you said and so from here, We have a podcast that we recommend called The Wealthy Contractor by Brian Casavan. And so from here, it gives a little bit of a reason why. Then from here, it says, hey, here's your next conference. The next in-person conference that aligns with your focus areas is here. So you don't have to go searching everything. We've already approved the conference as a quality as important to you, right? And then from here, it recommends partners. So destination motivation is great because of X, Y, and Z. Remember when I clicked 21 to 30 million in my revenue? Well, right here, I can go, I can click this button and I can hear from similar customers in my size, in my category.

35:21 - Thomas D Traub
I love it.

35:22 - Greg Cummings
So now the partners love it, the contractors love it, or in your case, the manufacturers love it because you're pairing them with all the right people to help them get their business better.

35:38 - Thomas D Traub
Yeah, we got to get this in front of our guys real quick. What's the next step? Obviously the free side of the coin. What is the the what is the because these guys will be what else can I get?

35:56 - Greg Cummings
What else can I get? What else can I get? Yeah, uh from who from the contractor or from y'all's perspective from you Yeah, so in the concierge, what does the concierge build out The concierge is literally free So all of our partners for right now, so where's your reference So our revenue is going to be from our partners, from the strategic partners, RILA, Destination Motivation. We're going to have a barter system with conferences because we want the people. And then if like, if like, for instance, is their mind slipping? What is the name? What? I'm sorry.

36:36 - Thomas D Traub
No, that's the, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but that, that's the best thing. If I could tell you today, Mr. Contractor, that all the questions that you have swimming on your head, I can give you a free opportunity to connect with others in the industry that are at a similar level that you are, why would you say no to me? Give me the answer.

37:02 - Greg Cummings
If you want to supply this to all your customers, and you want the feedback, and you want all of the data and all the reporting, whoever gets the reporting is who pays us as long as you qualify. So there's a qualification onboarding process. And obviously you guys would qualify, but like, then it's anywhere from to be lit just to be listed is going to be about 1200 bucks a month. That's it. But if you want to have the premium package where we do video content, we interview you, we interview your and we really show why because then there'll be another button here that says click here like in the quarterly reports it'll have the quarterly report but then right below it is gonna have all of power 100s interviews testimonials video content it's gonna be a mini sales page where literally if you're in a sales meeting you'll be able to just bring it back and so we would do the same thing for our manufacturing partners as well so somebody's on the fence about it. Oh, well, we have 55, you know, customers, let's say, no, 550 customers that are, you know, between 11 million and 20 million. Would you like to hear from them on the, and here's their trend of what, of what they've done with us. And oh, by the way, the benefit of working with us is you get access to this.

38:26 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

38:26 - Thomas D Traub
I need what I'm going to actually call today. Cause we've got, I've got, I'm going to be gone.

38:32 - Greg Cummings
We have the top price this product, the most expensive line is only $5,000 a month. The bottom is $1,200. The top is $5,000.

38:43 - Thomas D Traub
They pay that a month right now for Zonda. I'm telling you, because we have it nationally with CBB and we have all of it. I think it's probably more than that. So, that's a drop in the bucket for Cornerstone.

39:01 - Unidentified Speaker
Right.

39:03 - Thomas D Traub
Okay. All right. I'm so glad we had the meeting today. Yeah, brother.

39:07 - Greg Cummings

So if you don't mind, I'm going to jump and do that. But dude, brother, always great catching up and get with those guys. When are you back in the office? Are you out all next week?

39:30 - Thomas D Traub

But then the week after, all of our business development teams together, and I want to be able to, if you've got time that week, I'll put you on a Teams call. Some of us will be in Fort Myers, some of us will be in California. I'd like to bring you in. So I'm going to work that out. Absolutely. Okay.

39:53 - Greg Cummings
