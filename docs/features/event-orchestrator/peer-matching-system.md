# ü§ù Peer Matching System - Event Networking Intelligence

**Intelligent Peer-to-Peer Connection System for Events**

*Last Updated: September 26, 2025*
*Status: Production Ready*
*Phase: Event Orchestrator Phase 5*

---

## üìã Overview & Purpose

The Peer Matching System intelligently connects contractors at events with non-competing peers who share similar business challenges but operate in different geographic markets. Unlike random networking, our AI-driven matching ensures every introduction is valuable, relevant, and has high potential for long-term collaboration.

### Key Benefits
- **Strategic Connections**: Match based on business challenges, not just industry
- **Non-Competing**: Geographic separation ensures no market competition
- **Similar Scale**: Connect with peers at similar business stages
- **Smart Timing**: Coordinate introductions during breaks and downtime
- **Mutual Opt-in**: Both parties agree before contact info is shared
- **Track Success**: PCR scoring measures connection quality

### Use Cases
1. **Peer Learning**: Share strategies with someone facing same challenges
2. **Best Practice Exchange**: Learn from peers in different markets
3. **Problem Solving**: Get fresh perspectives from outside your market
4. **Long-term Relationships**: Build ongoing peer advisory relationships
5. **Market Expansion**: Learn about operating in new markets

## üßÆ Matching Algorithm

### Scoring Weights

The matching algorithm uses four weighted criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Focus Area Overlap** | 40% | Ensures shared business challenges |
| **Geographic Separation** | 25% | Guarantees non-competing markets |
| **Business Scale Similarity** | 20% | Matches similar-sized companies |
| **Industry Alignment** | 15% | Same vertical for relevant insights |

### 1. Focus Area Overlap (40%)

**Calculation**: Jaccard similarity of focus areas
```javascript
commonAreas / totalUniqueAreas
```

**Examples**:
- Both focus on "hiring" and "operations": **0.9 score**
- One overlap out of 4 total areas: **0.25 score**
- No overlap: **0.0 score**

**Why it matters**: Contractors want to talk with peers facing the same challenges.

### 2. Geographic Separation (25%)

**Scoring**:
- Different states: **1.0** (perfect - no competition)
- Same state, different cities: **0.5** (moderate separation)
- Same city: **0.2** (competing market - low score)

**Examples**:
- Phoenix, AZ vs Dallas, TX: **1.0**
- Dallas, TX vs Austin, TX: **0.5**
- Dallas, TX vs Dallas, TX: **0.2**

**Why it matters**: Peers in non-competing markets freely share strategies.

### 3. Business Scale Similarity (20%)

**Revenue Tier Comparison**:
```javascript
Revenue Tiers: under_500k, 500k_1m, 1m_2m, 2m_5m, 5m_10m, 10m_plus

Same tier: 1.0
Adjacent tier (e.g., 1m_2m vs 2m_5m): 0.8
2 tiers apart: 0.5
3+ tiers apart: 0.3
```

**Team Size Comparison**:
```javascript
Within 20% of each other: 1.0
Within 50%: 0.8
Within 100% (2x difference): 0.5
More than 2x different: 0.3
```

**Final Scale Score**: Average of revenue and team size scores

**Why it matters**: Similar-sized businesses face similar operational challenges.

### 4. Industry Alignment (15%)

**Calculation**: Services offered overlap
```javascript
commonServices / max(servicesCount1, servicesCount2)
```

**Examples**:
- Both in HVAC: **1.0**
- Both in home services: **0.7**
- One HVAC, one electrical: **0.5**

**Why it matters**: Industry context makes advice more actionable.

### Overall Match Score

```javascript
finalScore = (focusScore √ó 0.40) +
             (geoScore √ó 0.25) +
             (scaleScore √ó 0.20) +
             (industryScore √ó 0.15)
```

**Match Types Based on Score**:
- **0.8+**: "ideal_peer" - Perfect match
- **0.7-0.79**: "focus_area_match" - Strong on challenges
- **0.6-0.69**: "scale_match" - Similar business size
- **<0.6**: Not recommended (filtered out by default)

## üí¨ SMS Conversation Flow

### Phase 1: Introduction Prompt

**Message Template**:
```
Hey {firstName}! üëã

ü§ù Find Your Peer: I found someone perfect for you to meet!

{peerName} from {peerCompany} ({peerLocation}) - you're both focused on {commonFocusAreas}.

They're in a non-competing market, so this is a great chance to share strategies!

Reply YES to get an intro, or LATER if you want to connect during a break.
```

**Example**:
```
Hey John! üëã

ü§ù Find Your Peer: I found someone perfect for you to meet!

Sarah Johnson from ABC Contractors (Dallas, TX) - you're both focused on hiring and operations.

They're in a non-competing market, so this is a great chance to share strategies!

Reply YES to get an intro, or LATER if you want to connect during a break.
```

### Phase 2: Response Handling

**Scenario A: Both Say "YES" Immediately**
```
Great news, John! üéâ

Sarah Johnson (ABC Contractors) also wants to connect!

üì± 555-123-4567
‚úâÔ∏è sarah@abccontractors.com

I've sent them your info too. Enjoy the conversation!
```

**Scenario B: One Says "LATER"**
```
No problem! I'll check back with you during the next break.

Break time is at 10:30 AM. Perfect time to connect!
```

### Phase 3: Break-Time Coordination

**5 Minutes Before Break**:
```
Hey John!

‚òï Break time in 5 minutes!

Want to meet Sarah at the networking area? They're waiting to connect with you.

Reply YES to confirm or SKIP if you need this break.
```

### Phase 4: Contact Exchange (After Both Agree)

**Sent to Both Parties**:
```
Great news, {firstName}! üéâ

{peerName} ({peerCompany}) also wants to connect!

üì± {peerPhone}
‚úâÔ∏è {peerEmail}

I've sent them your info too. Enjoy the conversation!
```

### Phase 5: Post-Connection Follow-up

**After Meeting (2-3 hours later)**:
```
Hey John!

How was your chat with Sarah?

Reply with a quick rating (1-10) to help us make better matches in the future!
```

## üìç Smart Timing System

### Optimal Prompt Times

The system suggests 5 key times to prompt peer introductions:

#### 1. Arrival Time (15 min before event start)
```javascript
{
  time: eventStart - 15min,
  context: 'arrival',
  message: 'Perfect timing to meet before the first session!'
}
```

#### 2. Coffee/Morning Break (5 min before break)
```javascript
{
  time: breakStart - 5min,
  context: 'break',
  location: 'networking area',
  message: 'Break time - perfect for a quick peer chat!'
}
```

#### 3. Lunch (5 min after lunch starts)
```javascript
{
  time: lunchStart + 5min,
  context: 'lunch',
  location: 'lunch area',
  message: 'Grab lunch together and talk shop!'
}
```

#### 4. Afternoon Break (5 min before)
```javascript
{
  time: afternoonBreak - 5min,
  context: 'break',
  location: 'networking area',
  message: 'Another great time to connect!'
}
```

#### 5. Post-Event Networking (30 min before event ends)
```javascript
{
  time: eventEnd - 30min,
  context: 'networking',
  message: 'Last chance to connect before everyone leaves!'
}
```

### Timing Strategy

**Immediate Matching** (check-in time):
- Best for: High-score matches (0.85+)
- Reason: Don't wait - these are perfect matches

**Break-time Matching**:
- Best for: Medium-score matches (0.7-0.84)
- Reason: Lower pressure, natural networking time

**Lunch Matching**:
- Best for: All matches
- Reason: Longest unstructured time, relaxed setting

**End-of-day Matching**:
- Best for: Rescuing missed opportunities
- Reason: Last chance before everyone leaves

## üéØ Match Type Definitions

### Ideal Peer (0.8+ score)
**Criteria**:
- Focus area overlap > 0.8
- Geographic separation > 0.8
- High overall score

**Characteristics**:
- Same business challenges
- Different markets
- Similar company size
- Same industry

**Value Proposition**: "This person is dealing with the exact same issues you are, but in a market far enough away that you can share openly."

**Example**:
```
John (Phoenix HVAC, $2M, 15 employees, focused on hiring)
Sarah (Dallas HVAC, $2.5M, 18 employees, focused on hiring)
Score: 0.89
```

### Focus Area Match (0.7-0.79)
**Criteria**:
- Focus area overlap > 0.6
- May be in same state or closer geographically

**Characteristics**:
- Shared challenges are primary driver
- Geographic separation might be less
- Industry alignment strong

**Value Proposition**: "You're both tackling the same problems - worth connecting even if you're in nearby markets."

**Example**:
```
John (Phoenix HVAC, $2M, focused on hiring + operations)
Mike (Tucson HVAC, $5M, focused on hiring + customer retention)
Score: 0.74
```

### Scale Match (0.6-0.69)
**Criteria**:
- Business scale similarity > 0.8
- May have fewer focus area overlaps

**Characteristics**:
- Similar company size
- Facing similar growth stage challenges
- Different focus areas but similar operations

**Value Proposition**: "You're at the same stage of growth - they understand your operational challenges."

**Example**:
```
John (Phoenix HVAC, $2M, 15 employees)
Lisa (San Diego Plumbing, $2.2M, 16 employees)
Score: 0.67
```

### General Match (<0.6)
**Status**: Filtered out by default

**Why**: Below quality threshold for proactive introductions. These matches might happen organically but shouldn't be system-recommended.

## üíª Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Matches at Event Check-in

```javascript
// When contractor checks in to event
const contractorId = 123;
const eventId = 456;

// Find top 3 peer matches
const matches = await fetch(
  `/api/event-messaging/event/${eventId}/contractor/${contractorId}/peer-matches?maxMatches=3&minScore=0.7`
);

const response = await matches.json();
console.log(`Found ${response.count} matches`);

// Top match
const topMatch = response.matches[0];
console.log(`Best match: ${topMatch.first_name} ${topMatch.last_name}`);
console.log(`Score: ${topMatch.matchScore}`);
console.log(`Reason: ${topMatch.matchReason}`);
```

### Example 2: Create Match and Send Introduction

```javascript
// Create the match record
const matchResult = await fetch(`/api/event-messaging/event/${eventId}/peer-match`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contractorId: 123,
    peerId: 456,
    matchData: topMatch
  })
});

const match = await matchResult.json();
const matchId = match.match.id;

// Generate and send introduction SMS
const introMessage = peerMatchingService.generatePeerIntroductionSMS(
  contractor1,
  contractor2,
  match
);

await fetch(`/api/event-messaging/peer-match/${matchId}/introduction`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: introMessage })
});
```

### Example 3: Handle SMS Response

```javascript
// Webhook from SMS service (contractor responds "YES")
app.post('/webhook/sms-response', async (req, res) => {
  const { phone, message } = req.body;

  // Find contractor by phone
  const contractor = await findContractorByPhone(phone);

  // Check if response is for peer match
  const pendingMatch = await findPendingPeerMatch(contractor.id);

  if (pendingMatch && message.toLowerCase().includes('yes')) {
    // Record positive response
    await fetch(`/api/event-messaging/peer-match/${pendingMatch.id}/response`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        contractorId: contractor.id,
        response: true
      })
    });

    // Check if both parties have responded
    const match = await getMatch(pendingMatch.id);

    if (match.contractor1_response && match.contractor2_response) {
      // Both said yes - exchange contact info!
      await sendContactExchange(match);

      // Record connection made
      await fetch(`/api/event-messaging/peer-match/${match.id}/connection`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          meetingDetails: { scheduled: false }
        })
      });
    }
  }

  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

### Example 4: Schedule Break-Time Prompts

```javascript
// Get event schedule
const eventSchedule = {
  startTime: '2025-09-26T09:00:00Z',
  breaks: [
    { start: '2025-09-26T10:30:00Z', location: 'Networking Area' },
    { start: '2025-09-26T14:30:00Z', location: 'Networking Area' }
  ],
  lunch: { start: '2025-09-26T12:00:00Z', location: 'Lunch Area' },
  endTime: '2025-09-26T17:00:00Z'
};

// Get suggested prompt times
const promptTimes = peerMatchingService.getSuggestedPromptTimes(eventSchedule);

// Schedule matches for each time slot
promptTimes.forEach(slot => {
  if (slot.context === 'break') {
    // Schedule break-time coordination messages
    scheduleBreakTimePrompt(slot.time, slot.location);
  }
});
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Match Quality Indicators

**High-Quality Match** (What to aim for):
- Match score > 0.75
- Both parties respond "YES"
- Meeting actually happens
- PCR score > 7.5
- Follow-up contact after event

**Medium-Quality Match**:
- Match score 0.6-0.75
- At least one party responds positively
- PCR score 5-7.5

**Low-Quality Match** (Learn and improve):
- Match score < 0.6
- No response or both decline
- PCR score < 5

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Match Acceptance Rate**: % of introductions that both parties accept
2. **Connection Rate**: % of accepted matches that actually meet
3. **Average PCR Score**: Quality rating from contractors
4. **Follow-up Rate**: % that exchange contact info for post-event follow-up
5. **Long-term Value**: Do they stay in touch 30/60/90 days later?

## üîí Privacy & Best Practices

### Consent & Opt-in
- Contractors must opt-in to peer matching at registration
- Can opt-out at any time via SMS ("STOP PEER")
- Contact info only shared after both parties agree
- Can decline specific matches without penalty

### Data Protection
- Match criteria stored securely
- SMS messages encrypted in transit
- Phone numbers never shown until mutual agreement
- GDPR/CCPA compliant deletion on request

### Quality Control
- Minimum match score threshold (0.6) prevents low-quality matches
- Limit introductions to 3-5 per event (avoid overwhelming)
- Space out prompts (no more than 1 per hour)
- Learn from declined matches to improve algorithm

### Best Practices for Event Organizers
1. **Set Expectations**: Tell contractors about peer matching during registration
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why you're matching them (share the algorithm basics)
3. **Respect Boundaries**: If someone declines, don't push
4. **Create Opportunities**: Have designated networking areas/times
5. **Measure Success**: Track PCR scores and improve matching criteria
