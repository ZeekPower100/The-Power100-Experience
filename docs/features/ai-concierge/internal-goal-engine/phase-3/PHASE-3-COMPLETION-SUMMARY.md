## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### What Worked Well

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Writing tests first caught edge cases early
   - 100% test coverage gives high confidence
   - E2E tests validated complete integration

2. **Database-First Approach**
   - Pre-flight checklist prevented field name bugs
   - CASCADE deletes simplified cleanup
   - CHECK constraints enforced data quality

3. **Safeguard Layering**
   - Multiple safeguard layers prevent edge cases
   - Graduated response (warn → pause) is user-friendly
   - Emergency stop provides safety net

4. **Template Validation**
   - Forbidden phrases list prevents robotic messaging
   - Quality scoring ensures consistency
   - Multiple variants enable A/B testing

5. **Trust-Based Adaptation**
   - Behavior adjustment based on trust feels natural
   - Memory integration builds rapport
   - Automatic pause at low trust prevents damage

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Test Sequencing**
   - Issue: Test 4 failed due to max goals limit from Test 3
   - Solution: Reordered tests (Test 4 before Test 3)

2. **Trust Score Validation**
   - Issue: Validation expected number type, received string
   - Solution: Added parseFloat() conversion

3. **Function Signature Mismatches**
   - Issue: E2E tests called non-existent functions
   - Solution: Checked exports and corrected function calls

4. **Data Gap Field Names**
   - Issue: Used invalid field names in question generation
   - Solution: Referenced DATA_GAP_FIELDS constant
