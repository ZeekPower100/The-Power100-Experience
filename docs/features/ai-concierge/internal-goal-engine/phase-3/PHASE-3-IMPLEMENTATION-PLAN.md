# Phase 3: Proactive Behavior & Evolution - Implementation Plan

**Feature:** AI Concierge Internal Goal Engine
**Phase:** 3 of 3 - Proactive Behavior & Evolution
**Timeline:** 5-7 days
**Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## üìã Overview

### What This Phase Delivers
**Proactive Behavior & Evolution** is the final phase that transforms the AI Concierge from a reactive assistant into a proactive business partner that initiates conversations, schedules its own follow-ups, and continuously improves based on contractor responses.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Proactive message initiation system (AI starts conversations)
2. Enhanced follow-up scheduler (AI schedules based on goals)
3. Natural question asking engine (fills data gaps conversationally)
4. Goal evolution logic (goals adapt based on contractor behavior)
5. Trust-building memory system (remembers and references past interactions)

**What It Enables:**
- AI initiates conversations without being prompted
- AI schedules follow-ups based on internal goals
- AI asks strategic questions naturally during conversation
- Goals evolve based on contractor progress and feedback
- AI feels like it's "always working" for the contractor

   - Triggers:
     - Time-based: 3 days after event, 1 week after action item
     - Goal-based: High-priority goal with data gaps
     - Pattern-based: "89% of contractors did X at this stage"
   - Return prioritized list of messages to send

#### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ All 4 tables created with correct schema
- ‚úÖ Proactive message service can schedule messages
- ‚úÖ Trigger system identifies when to reach out
- ‚úÖ Message outcomes tracked (responded, ignored, etc.)

#### Verification Commands:

   - Track question success in `ai_question_log`

2. **Data Gap Prioritization** (2 hours)
   - Extend Phase 1's data gap detection
   - Prioritize gaps by:
     - Goal importance (high-priority goals first)
     - Pattern relevance (gaps that patterns need)
     - Contractor stage (right timing for question)
   - Create natural question templates for each gap type

3. **Question Effectiveness Tracking** (2 hours)
   - Track: Did contractor answer?
   - Track: Did answer fill data gap?
   - Track: How natural did question feel? (1-5 score)
   - Use feedback to improve future questions

4. **Integration with Conversation Flow** (1 hour)
   - Inject questions into AI responses naturally
   - Never ask 2+ questions in same message

- ‚úÖ AI generates natural questions based on data gaps
- ‚úÖ Questions tracked in question_log
- ‚úÖ Effectiveness metrics calculated
- ‚úÖ Questions feel conversational, not interrogative

#### Test Cases:
```javascript
// Test: Generate question for "close_rate" data gap
const question = await generateStrategicQuestion(contractorId, 'close_rate', goalId);
expect(question).toContain('close rate');
expect(question).not.toContain('please provide');  // Not robotic
expect(question.length).toBeLessThan(200);  // Concise

// Test: Track question effectiveness
await trackQuestion(contractorId, question, 'close_rate');
const answered = await checkIfAnswered(questionId);
expect(answered).toBe(true);
```

     - Goal priority (high-priority goals get faster follow-ups)
     - Checklist triggers (after milestone, after data collected)
     - Pattern timelines ("most contractors do X within 2 weeks")
   - Auto-cancel if contractor completes action early

2. **Follow-Up Message Generation** (2 hours)
   - Generate context-aware follow-up messages
   - Reference past conversation: "Remember you mentioned hiring challenges?"
   - Include pattern data: "Contractors who did X saw 40% improvement"
   - Keep tone helpful, not pushy

3. **Smart Timing Logic** (2 hours)
   - Don't follow up too soon (min 2 days)
   - Don't follow up too late (max 2 weeks for urgent items)
   - Respect contractor's response patterns (some prefer weekly check-ins)
   - Adjust timing based on past response rates

4. **Integration with Existing Systems** (1 hour)
   - Link to `contractor_action_items` (follow up on AI-created actions)
   - Link to `ai_concierge_goals` (follow up advances goal)
   - Update goal progress when follow-up completed

#### Success Criteria:

   - Track changes in `ai_goal_evolution_log`
   - Reasons for evolution:
     - Contractor feedback indicates different priority
     - Pattern data updated (new insights)
     - Goal stalled (no progress in 30 days)
     - Contractor achieved milestone early

2. **Automatic Goal Adjustment** (2 hours)
   - If contractor ignores goal ‚Üí lower priority
   - If contractor engages ‚Üí increase priority

     - AI follows up at perfect time
     - Goal achieved thanks to AI guidance
   - Calculate cumulative trust score

2. **Memory Integration** (2 hours)
   - When AI responds, inject relevant memories
   - "Remember you mentioned hiring challenges at the event?"
   - "Last time you said X, want to revisit that?"
   - Pull from: conversation history, event notes, action items

3. **Trust Score Impact** (2 hours)
   - Track contractor's trust in AI (cumulative score)
   - Use trust score to:
     - Adjust proactive message frequency (higher trust = more proactive)
     - Determine question boldness (higher trust = ask harder questions)
     - Schedule follow-up timing (higher trust = more flexible)

4. **Trust Decay Prevention** (1 hour)
   - If AI makes bad recommendation ‚Üí -5 trust
   - If AI forgets important detail ‚Üí -3 trust
   - If AI spams with messages ‚Üí -2 trust per message
   - Minimum trust threshold: pause proactive behavior if too low

#### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Trust events tracked with scores
- ‚úÖ AI references past interactions naturally
- ‚úÖ Trust score influences AI behavior
- ‚úÖ System prevents trust decay

#### Example Trust Building:
```
[Week after event]

AI Internal Check:
- Trust event: "remembered_detail" from event notes
- Contractor mentioned: "hiring challenges for operations"
- Goal: "Prepare for team expansion" (priority 8/10)
- Action: Reference memory + provide value

AI Message:
"Remember you mentioned hiring challenges at the event?
Found a hiring playbook from contractors who scaled past $5M.
Want the link?"

Result: Trust +5 (helpful + remembered detail)
```
