# AI Concierge Event Orchestrator Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the 3 critical enhancements needed to enable the AI Concierge to fully deliver Greg's vision for interactive event orchestration, note-taking, priority management, and proactive follow-ups.

**Current State:** AI Concierge has excellent conversational intelligence and comprehensive knowledge base, but is READ-ONLY and REACTIVE-ONLY.

**Target State:** AI Concierge can capture notes, create action items, schedule follow-ups, and proactively check in on contractor progress.

---

## Enhancement #1: Event Orchestration System Prompt Update

### **Goal**
Update the AI Concierge system prompt to include event orchestration instructions, note-taking behavior, priority extraction, and follow-up guidance.

### **Current Behavior**
- AI responds to general business questions
- AI recommends partners, books, podcasts
- AI maintains conversation context
- **AI does NOT** ask event-specific questions
- **AI does NOT** recognize notes being shared
- **AI does NOT** extract priorities from conversations

### **Target Behavior**
- AI detects when contractor is at an event (from event context data)
- AI recognizes when contractor is sharing a note vs asking a question
- AI asks clarifying questions: "What session are you in?"
- AI extracts entities from notes (names, phones, emails, companies)
- AI asks post-event: "What are your top 3 priorities?"
- AI offers to help with action items: "Want me to draft an intro email?"
- AI references event context naturally in conversations

### **Implementation Details**

**File to modify:** `tpe-backend/src/services/openAIService.js`

**Section to update:** `generateResponse()` function, system prompt (line 639)

**New prompt sections to add:**

```javascript
// SECTION 1: EVENT DETECTION
CURRENT EVENT CONTEXT:
${contractor is at event ? `
üé™ CONTRACTOR IS CURRENTLY AT: ${event.name}
- Event Date: ${event.date}
- Location: ${event.location}
- Current Time: ${currentTime}
- Event Status: ${eventStatus} (pre-event, during-event, post-event)

YOUR EVENT ORCHESTRATOR ROLE:
During events, you shift into "Event Orchestrator" mode with these responsibilities:
` : 'Contractor is not currently at an event.'}

// SECTION 2: NOTE-TAKING INSTRUCTIONS
1. NOTE-TAKING DURING EVENTS:
When contractor shares information during event, treat it as a note to capture:

DETECT NOTES by looking for:
- Names mentioned: "Met John Smith"
- Contact info shared: "555-1234" or "john@example.com"
- Insights recorded: "Great point about AI automation"
- Action items stated: "Need to follow up on this"
- Session references: "In the marketing session right now"

ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS:
- "What session are you in right now?"
- "Is this about a speaker, sponsor, or peer you met?"
- "Should I mark this as something to follow up on?"

EXTRACT ENTITIES automatically:
- Names (people, companies)
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Key topics/insights
- Action items

RESPOND NATURALLY:
‚úÖ "Got it! I'll make note of that. Are you in the [speaker name] session right now?"
‚úÖ "Perfect, I'll remember John Smith's info. What specifically interested you about his insights?"
‚úÖ "Noted! I'll remind you to follow up with them after the event."
‚ùå Don't say: "I will store this in the database" (too technical)

// SECTION 3: SESSION CONTEXT AWARENESS
2. SESSION AWARENESS:
Know the event schedule and current time to provide context:

${eventSchedule ? `
CURRENT/UPCOMING SESSIONS:
${formatEventSchedule(eventSchedule)}

- Reference sessions naturally: "Based on the AI automation session you're in..."
- Suggest relevant upcoming sessions: "The marketing session at 3pm might interest you based on your focus areas"
- Connect notes to sessions: "From the [speaker] session, you noted..."
` : ''}

// SECTION 4: POST-EVENT PRIORITY EXTRACTION
3. POST-EVENT PRIORITY EXTRACTION:
After event ends (status: post-event), initiate priority conversation:

YOUR OPENING MESSAGE (after event):
"Hey [Name]! Hope you had an amazing time at [Event Name]! üéâ

I have a complete summary of everything - your sessions, sponsor visits, and connections made.

Before I share the full wrap-up, what are the TOP 3 PRIORITIES you want to make sure we tackle from everything you experienced?"

LISTEN FOR PRIORITIES:
- Extract action items from their response
- Assign contractor_priority (1, 2, 3) based on their ranking
- Ask follow-up questions for clarity
- Suggest additional priorities based on event data

EXAMPLE EXTRACTION:
Contractor: "1. Follow up with John Smith, 2. Demo with Acme Corp, 3. Implement AI tools"

YOUR RESPONSE:
"Perfect! I'll create a follow-up plan for all three:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Follow up with John Smith - When should I check in to see if you've connected?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Acme Corp demo - I see it's scheduled for Oct 16. Want help preparing questions?
3Ô∏è‚É£ AI tools implementation - Which tools from the event interested you most?

I'll check in proactively on each of these. Sound good?"

// SECTION 5: FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULING
4. PROACTIVE FOLLOW-UP BEHAVIOR:
When creating action items, suggest natural check-in times:

FOR CONTACT FOLLOW-UPS: "I'll check in 3 days from now to see if you've reached out"
FOR DEMO PREP: "I'll remind you the day before your demo"
FOR IMPLEMENTATION: "I'll check in weekly to see how it's going"

NATURAL CHECK-IN LANGUAGE:
‚úÖ "Hey! Just checking in - have you had a chance to connect with John Smith yet?"
‚úÖ "Your demo with Acme is tomorrow at 2pm. Need help preparing questions?"
‚úÖ "How did the call with John go? Anything interesting come up?"

// SECTION 6: EMAIL INTRODUCTION ASSISTANCE
5. EMAIL INTRODUCTION FACILITATION:
Offer to help with email introductions to peers/partners met at event:

DETECT OPPORTUNITY:
- Contractor mentions wanting to follow up
- Action item created for "contact_peer" or "email_intro"

OFFER ASSISTANCE:
"Want me to draft an introduction email for you? I can include context from when you met at [Event]."

IF YES:
"Here's a draft you can use:

Subject: Great connecting at [Event Name]

Hi [Name],

It was great meeting you at [Event] - really enjoyed our conversation about [topic from notes].

[Specific reference from their conversation/notes]

Would love to continue the discussion. Are you available for a quick call next week?

Best,
[Contractor Name]

Feel free to copy this or I can adjust it however you like!"

// SECTION 7: NON-EVENT PARTNER RECOMMENDATIONS
6. POST-EVENT PARTNER RECOMMENDATIONS:
After contractor completes their event priorities, recommend partners NOT at the event:

TIMING: 2-3 weeks post-event, after top priorities addressed

EXAMPLE:
"Hey! I saw your focus area was [focus_area]. There was [Partner A] and [Partner B] at the event, but I also want to mention [Partner C] - they specialize in exactly what you're looking for and have a 9.2 PowerConfidence score.

They weren't at [Event] but they're incredible. Want to learn more?"

// SECTION 8: CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT
7. MAINTAIN EVENT CONTEXT IN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS:
Continue referencing event learnings in future conversations:

NATURAL REFERENCES:
‚úÖ "Based on what you learned at [Event] about [topic]..."
‚úÖ "Remember when you met [Person] at [Event] and they mentioned [insight]?"
‚úÖ "Following up on that [topic] session you attended..."

BUILD ON EVENT MOMENTUM:
- Use event insights to guide future recommendations
- Reference speakers/sessions when making suggestions
- Connect event learnings to current challenges
```

### **Testing Criteria**
Before marking this enhancement complete, AI must demonstrate:

1. ‚úÖ Detect when contractor shares a note vs asks a question
2. ‚úÖ Ask "What session are you in?" when note context is unclear
3. ‚úÖ Naturally extract names, phones, emails from conversation
4. ‚úÖ After event, ask "What are your top 3 priorities?"
5. ‚úÖ Offer to help with email introductions
6. ‚úÖ Suggest check-in times when discussing action items
7. ‚úÖ Reference event context in ongoing conversations

### **Files Modified**
- `tpe-backend/src/services/openAIService.js` - Update system prompt in `generateResponse()`

### **Estimated Time**
- **Development:** 2 hours
- **Testing:** 2 hours
- **Total:** 4 hours

## Enhancement #2: Function Calling for Database Writes

### **Goal**
Enable AI Concierge to write to database tables (`event_notes`, `contractor_action_items`, `contractor_followup_schedules`) through GPT-4 function calling.

### **Current Behavior**
- AI can READ all database tables via `aiKnowledgeService.js`
- AI can SEE event notes, action items, follow-up schedules
- **AI CANNOT** create new notes
- **AI CANNOT** create action items
- **AI CANNOT** schedule follow-ups

### **Target Behavior**
- AI detects when it should capture a note ‚Üí calls `capture_event_note()` function
- AI detects when contractor states a priority ‚Üí calls `create_action_item()` function
- AI detects when to schedule follow-up ‚Üí calls `schedule_followup()` function
- Database is automatically updated without additional API calls
- AI responds naturally: "Got it, I'll make note of that" (note already captured)

### **Implementation Details**

## Enhancement #3: Proactive Follow-Up Scheduler

### **Goal**
Build a background service that checks `contractor_followup_schedules` table every 5 minutes and sends proactive check-in messages via AI Concierge.

### **Current Behavior**
- Follow-up schedules can be created in database
- **No automated execution** - they sit in database forever
- AI only responds to INBOUND messages (reactive only)

### **Target Behavior**
- Every 5 minutes, service checks for pending follow-ups
- AI generates personalized message using context hints
- Message sent via n8n webhook (same as other outbound messages)
- Follow-up marked as "sent" in database
- If contractor responds, AI continues conversation naturally
- If action item already completed, follow-up is skipped

### **Implementation Details**

#### **STEP 1: Create Follow-Up Scheduler Service**

#### **STEP 2: Integrate Scheduler into Server**

**File to modify:** `tpe-backend/server.js`

```javascript
// Add at top with other requires
const proactiveFollowUpScheduler = require('./src/services/proactiveFollowUpScheduler');

// Add after server starts (after app.listen())
if (process.env.ENABLE_FOLLOWUP_SCHEDULER !== 'false') {
  // Start proactive follow-up scheduler
  proactiveFollowUpScheduler.startScheduler();
  console.log('‚úÖ Proactive follow-up scheduler started');
}
```

#### **STEP 3: Environment Variable Configuration**

**File to modify:** `.env` (both development and production)

```bash
# Proactive Follow-Up Scheduler
ENABLE_FOLLOWUP_SCHEDULER=true  # Set to false to disable scheduler
```

#### **STEP 4: Manual Trigger Endpoint (for testing)**

**New endpoint in:** `tpe-backend/src/routes/eventMessagingRoutes.js`

```javascript
// Manual trigger for testing proactive follow-ups
router.post('/trigger-followups', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const proactiveFollowUpScheduler = require('../services/proactiveFollowUpScheduler');

  await proactiveFollowUpScheduler.checkAndSendPendingFollowUps();

  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Follow-up scheduler triggered manually'
  });
}));
```

**Estimated Time:** 10 hours
**Deliverable:** AI captures everything and creates action items

### **Phase 3: Proactive Scheduler** ‚úÖ
**Goal:** AI proactively checks in on contractor progress
**Estimated Time:** 9 hours
**Deliverable:** Complete Greg's vision - fully autonomous event orchestration

**Total Estimated Time:** 23 hours (~3 days)

---

## Success Criteria

### **Complete Event Orchestration Flow**

**DURING EVENT:**
1. Contractor: "Met John Smith - great insights on AI. 555-1234, john@example.com"
2. AI: "Awesome! What session are you in right now?"
3. Contractor: "The AI automation session"
4. AI: "Perfect! I'll make note of that. What specifically interested you about his insights?"
5. ‚úÖ Note captured in `event_notes` with extracted entities and session context

**POST-EVENT:**
6. AI: "Hey! Hope you had an amazing time at Power100 Dallas! üéâ What are your top 3 priorities from everything you experienced?"
7. Contractor: "1. Follow up with John Smith, 2. Demo with Acme Corp, 3. Implement AI tools"
8. AI: "Perfect! I'll create a follow-up plan. When should I check in to see if you've connected with John?"
9. Contractor: "3 days"
10. AI: "Got it! I'll check in on Wednesday."
11. ‚úÖ 3 action items created in `contractor_action_items`
12. ‚úÖ Follow-up scheduled in `contractor_followup_schedules` for 3 days out

**3 DAYS LATER (PROACTIVE):**
13. AI: "Hey! Just checking in - have you had a chance to connect with John Smith yet?"
14. Contractor: "Yes! We had a great call yesterday"
15. AI: "That's awesome! How did it go? Anything interesting come up?"
16. ‚úÖ Action item marked completed in database
17. ‚úÖ Ongoing conversation continues naturally

---

## Testing Plan

### **Enhancement #1 Testing**
- [ ] Create test event with test contractor
- [ ] Send note during event: "Met Jane Doe, great speaker"
- [ ] Verify AI asks "What session are you in?"
- [ ] Send post-event message
- [ ] Verify AI asks "What are your top 3 priorities?"
- [ ] Verify AI references event context in responses

### **Enhancement #2 Testing**
- [ ] Same as above, plus:
- [ ] Verify `event_notes` table populated with note
- [ ] Verify `extracted_entities` JSONB has names extracted
- [ ] Verify `contractor_action_items` created for each priority
- [ ] Verify `contractor_priority` field matches stated ranking
- [ ] Verify AI responds naturally without mentioning database

### **Enhancement #3 Testing**
- [ ] Create action item with follow-up in 2 minutes
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes for scheduler to run
- [ ] Verify proactive message received via SMS
- [ ] Reply to message
- [ ] Verify AI continues conversation naturally
- [ ] Verify follow-up marked as "sent" in database
- [ ] Verify conversation logged to `event_messages`

---

## Rollback Plan

If any enhancement causes issues:

1. **Enhancement #1:** Simply revert `openAIService.js` system prompt changes
2. **Enhancement #2:** Set `ENABLE_FUNCTION_CALLING=false` in `.env`
3. **Enhancement #3:** Set `ENABLE_FOLLOWUP_SCHEDULER=false` in `.env`

All database tables remain intact and can be used later.

---

## Documentation Updates Needed

After completion, update these docs:
- [ ] `AI-FIRST-STRATEGY.md` - Mark Event Orchestrator as 100% complete
- [ ] `EVENT-SMS-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Add proactive follow-up flow diagram
- [ ] `AI-CONCIERGE-TESTING-GUIDE.md` - Add event orchestration test scenarios
- [ ] Create `EVENT-ORCHESTRATOR-USER-GUIDE.md` - Contractor-facing guide

---

## Notes

- All 3 enhancements are REQUIRED for Greg's vision
- Database schema already supports everything (completed earlier)
- AI Concierge routing already works (verified earlier)
- Core AI intelligence is strong - we're just adding specific behaviors
- This completes the "wholistic" system - ONE AI brain does EVERYTHING
