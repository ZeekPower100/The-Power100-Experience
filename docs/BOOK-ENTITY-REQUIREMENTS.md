# üìö Book Entity - Complete Data Requirements
*Incorporating Greg's Strategic Insights*

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy
Books are knowledge resources that help contractors solve specific problems. We need to understand not just WHAT the book contains, but WHO wrote it, WHY they wrote it, and HOW accessible they are for deeper engagement.

**IMPORTANT: For initial launch, ALL fields are OPTIONAL except basic contact info. We explain why each field matters but never block submission.**
