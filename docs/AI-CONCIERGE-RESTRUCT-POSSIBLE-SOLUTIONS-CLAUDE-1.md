Based on your complete system documentation, I can now give you much more targeted advice. Your current architecture has some fundamental issues that are causing the reliability problems you're experiencing:

## Core Problems I've Identified

1. **Over-reliance on real-time knowledge base assembly** - You're loading 89 tables with 1,443 columns on *every* AI request, then sending massive context windows to GPT-4. This is slow, expensive, and brittle.

2. **No separation between retrieval and generation** - Your `aiKnowledgeService.js` dumps everything into one giant context blob, forcing GPT-4 to do both retrieval AND reasoning simultaneously.

3. **Function calling as the only write mechanism** - This is unreliable for complex operations and doesn't scale well for your "breakthrough to next level" use case.

4. **Event context switching is procedural rather than architectural** - You're manually passing `eventContext` objects through layers instead of having a proper state management system.

## Better Architecture for Your Use Case

Given that you want to:
- Train your own industry-specific LLM eventually
- Support complex business advisory (not just event management)  
- Handle real-time event data reliably
- Scale beyond simple Q&A

Here's what you should look at:

### 1. **Hybrid RAG + Fine-tuning Architecture**

**[Vellum AI](https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-client-python)** (open-source alternative: **[txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai)** + **[Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor)**)
- Separates your knowledge base into:
  - **Cold data**: Industry knowledge, partner profiles, historical data → Fine-tune a smaller model
  - **Warm data**: Contractor profiles, goals, preferences → Embed and retrieve semantically  
  - **Hot data**: Real-time event schedules, live updates → Direct DB queries with caching

This solves your "unreliable retrieval" problem by matching data freshness to retrieval strategy.

### 2. **State Machine for Context Management**

**[XState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate)** (JavaScript state machines)
```javascript
// Instead of passing eventContext everywhere:
const conciergeStateMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'concierge',
  initial: 'general_advisory',
  states: {
    general_advisory: {
      on: { 
        CHECK_INTO_EVENT: 'pre_event',
        GOAL_BREAKTHROUGH_SESSION: 'strategic_planning'
      }
    },
    pre_event: {
      on: { EVENT_STARTS: 'during_event' }
    },
    during_event: {
      on: { EVENT_ENDS: 'post_event' }
      // Automatically loads event-specific retrieval strategies
    },
    strategic_planning: {
      // Multi-turn breakthrough planning mode
    }
  }
});
```

This gives you:
- Clear state transitions (no more manual `if (eventStatus === 'during_event')` checks)
- Automatic context loading per state
- Easy to add new modes (strategic planning, financial review, etc.)

### 3. **Proper Vector Database with Metadata Filtering**

**[Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)** or **[Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)** - Critical for your use case

Your current approach loads ALL partner data, then asks GPT-4 to filter. Instead:

```javascript
// Current (bad): Load everything, let GPT-4 figure it out
const allPartners = await loadAllPartners(); // 1,443 columns!
const response = await gpt4("Find partners for controlling lead flow", allPartners);

// Better: Semantic search with business logic filters
const relevantPartners = await qdrant.search({
  collection: "partners",
  query_vector: await embed("controlling lead flow"),
  filter: {
    must: [
      { key: "revenue_tier", match: { value: contractor.revenueTier } },
      { key: "power_confidence", range: { gte: 85 } }
    ]
  },
  limit: 3
});
```

This is **10x faster** and more reliable than your current approach.

### 4. **Multi-Agent System for Complex Advisory**

**[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)** - This is the critical missing piece for "helping them breakthrough"

Your current system has ONE agent doing everything. For complex business advisory, you need:

```javascript
// Breakthrough Planning Graph
const breakthroughGraph = new StateGraph({
  nodes: {
    discovery_agent: async (state) => {
      // Analyzes contractor's current state, goals, blockers
      return { blockers: [...], opportunities: [...] };
    },
    
    partner_matching_agent: async (state) => {
      // Uses Qdrant to find relevant partners
      return { recommended_partners: [...] };
    },
    
    resource_agent: async (state) => {
      // Finds books, podcasts, events
      return { resources: [...] };
    },
    
    action_planning_agent: async (state) => {
      // Creates 90-day breakthrough plan
      return { action_plan: [...] };
    },
    
    followup_agent: async (state) => {
      // Schedules checkpoints automatically
      return { followup_schedule: [...] };
    }
  },
  
  edges: {
    discovery_agent: ['partner_matching_agent', 'resource_agent'],
    partner_matching_agent: ['action_planning_agent'],
    resource_agent: ['action_planning_agent'],
    action_planning_agent: ['followup_agent']
  }
});
```

Each agent has a **specific job** with **specific data sources**. This is way more reliable than one mega-prompt.

### 5. **For PostgreSQL + AWS Specifically**

**[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)** - Add vector search directly to PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Add vector columns to existing tables
ALTER TABLE strategic_partners ADD COLUMN embedding vector(1536);

-- Semantic search WITHOUT external vector DB
SELECT company_name, ai_summary 
FROM strategic_partners
ORDER BY embedding <-> $1  -- contractor's goal embedding
LIMIT 3;
```

Combined with **[pgvector-python](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python)** or **[Supabase Vector](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)** for easier integration.

**[AWS Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)** - For your custom LLM training goal
- Keep using GPT-4 now
- Start collecting high-quality training data (contractor conversations + outcomes)
- When you have 10k+ examples, fine-tune Anthropic Claude or AWS Titan on Bedrock
- pgvector for semantic search, fine-tuned model for generation

### 6. **Better Event Data Handling**

**[Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)** - Solves your event orchestration reliability

Instead of Bull queues + Redis + manual scheduling:
```typescript
// Event workflow that handles ALL state automatically
@Workflow()
export class EventOrchestrationWorkflow {
  @WorkflowMethod()
  async execute(eventId: string, contractorId: string) {
    // Pre-event: Send prep materials
    await this.sendPreEventMessages();
    
    // Wait until event starts (Temporal handles the timing)
    await sleep(untilEventStart);
    
    // During event: Note capture mode
    await this.activateNoteCaptureMode();
    
    // Wait until event ends
    await sleep(untilEventEnd);
    
    // Post-event: Priority extraction
    const priorities = await this.extractPriorities();
    
    // Schedule follow-ups (automatically retries if failed)
    await this.scheduleFollowUps(priorities);
  }
}
```

Temporal handles:
- State persistence (no more Redis confusion)
- Automatic retries (reliability)
- Scheduling (no Bull queue debugging)
- Visibility (see exactly where each contractor is in the workflow)

## Specific Recommendations for Your System

### Short-term Fixes (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Add pgvector to PostgreSQL**
   - Embed all partners, books, podcasts once
   - Switch from "load all 89 tables" to "semantic search top 5 results"
   - This alone will cut your API costs 80% and improve reliability

2. **Split your knowledge base into tiers**
   ```javascript
   // Hot tier: Real-time event data (direct queries)
   const eventSchedule = await query('SELECT * FROM event_speakers WHERE event_id = $1', [eventId]);
   
   // Warm tier: Contractor-specific (cache 5 min)
   const contractorProfile = await getCached('contractor_profile', contractorId, 300);
   
   // Cold tier: General knowledge (cache 24 hours)
   const industryInsights = await getCached('industry_insights', 'all', 86400);
   ```

3. **Add explicit retrieval before generation**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of cramming everything into one GPT-4 call:
   
   // Step 1: Retrieve (fast, deterministic)
   const relevantPartners = await vectorSearch(query, limit=3);
   const relevantBooks = await vectorSearch(query, limit=2);
   
   // Step 2: Generate (only with relevant context)
   const response = await gpt4(query, { partners: relevantPartners, books: relevantBooks });
   ```

### Medium-term (Next 2 Months)

1. **Implement LangGraph for breakthrough planning**
   - Create a "Strategic Planning" mode separate from general chat
   - Multi-turn conversation with goal setting → resource matching → action planning
   - This becomes your killer feature beyond basic Q&A

2. **Replace Bull + Redis with Temporal**
   - More reliable follow-ups
   - Easier to debug (Temporal has a UI)
   - Better for complex multi-day workflows

3. **Start collecting training data**
   - Log every AI interaction with outcome
   - Track which recommendations led to partner engagement
   - This becomes your fine-tuning dataset

### Long-term (6-12 Months)

1. **Fine-tune industry-specific model on AWS Bedrock**
   - Use your collected data
   - Model understands contractor language natively
   - Reduce API costs 90% vs GPT-4

2. **Build agent orchestration for complex advisory**
   - Discovery → Analysis → Recommendations → Planning → Follow-up
   - Each step uses specialized retrieval + generation

## Bottom Line

Your current system is doing **too much in the wrong place** (GPT-4 is doing retrieval AND generation). You need:

1. **Semantic search first** (pgvector or Qdrant) → reduce context from 1,443 columns to top 5 results
2. **State machines** (XState) → replace your brittle `if (eventContext)` checks  
3. **Agent graphs** (LangGraph) → break complex advisory into specialized steps
4. **Proper workflow engine** (Temporal) → reliable follow-ups without debugging Bull queues

Start with #1 (pgvector semantic search) - that's a weekend project that will immediately fix your reliability issues. Then add state machines, then agent graphs.

The projects I mentioned all show production patterns for exactly this type of system. Danswer + txtai are probably your best starting points given your PostgreSQL + AWS stack.

Want me to create a specific migration plan showing how to move from your current `aiKnowledgeService.js` to a pgvector-based semantic search system?
