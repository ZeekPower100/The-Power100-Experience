# AI Coach Module - Comprehensive Architecture

## Overview

The AI Coach is a multimodal, industry-expert AI system that provides personalized insights to contractors based on comprehensive partner feedback data, contractor profiles, and partner demo content. Access is gated behind feedback loop completion to incentivize participation.

## Core Purpose

**Primary Objectives:**
- Provide unparalleled industry insights using aggregated feedback data
- Deliver partner-specific guidance based on real contractor experiences
- Enable contractors to ask questions like: "How are other window companies under $10M revenue using this service to grow?"
- Create competitive advantage through exclusive access to industry intelligence

## Access Control & Incentivization

### Gating Mechanism
- **Requirement**: Contractors must complete at least one feedback loop sequence
- **Database Flag**: `feedback_completion_status` in contractor profiles
- **Access Levels**:
  - `no_access`: No feedback completed (blocked from AI Coach)
  - `basic_access`: 1+ feedback completed (basic AI Coach access)
  - `premium_access`: 3+ feedback completed (advanced insights)

### User Journey
1. Contractor completes partner engagement
2. Receives feedback survey invitation
3. Completes feedback form
4. Gains access to AI Coach interface
5. Can ask questions about industry trends, partner performance, growth strategies

## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Layer
```
Partner Demos (Video) → Transcription + Visual Analysis → Knowledge Base
Feedback Forms (Text) → Structured Analysis → Knowledge Base  
Contractor Profiles → Contextual Data → Knowledge Base
Audio (Future) → Transcription + Sentiment → Knowledge Base
```

### AI Stack
- **Primary Model**: GPT-4V or Claude Vision (multimodal capabilities)
- **Audio Processing**: OpenAI Whisper API
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone or Weaviate for semantic search
- **Memory Management**: LangChain for conversation persistence
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Database Schema Extensions

#### New Tables
```sql
-- AI Coach access tracking
ai_coach_sessions (
  id, contractor_id, session_start, session_end, 
  message_count, topics_discussed, satisfaction_rating
)

-- Conversation memory
ai_coach_conversations (
  id, session_id, message_type, content, 
  timestamp, context_used, response_quality
)

-- Knowledge base embeddings
knowledge_embeddings (
  id, content_type, source_id, embedding_vector,
  metadata, last_updated, relevance_score
)

-- Partner demo processing
partner_demos (
  id, partner_id, demo_type, file_url, transcript,
  visual_summary, processing_status, knowledge_extracted
)
```

#### Modified Tables
```sql
-- Add feedback completion tracking
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN feedback_completion_status VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN ai_coach_access_level VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN total_feedback_completed INTEGER;

-- Add demo requirements to partners
ALTER TABLE strategic_partners ADD COLUMN demo_upload_status VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE strategic_partners ADD COLUMN initial_powerconfidence_score INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE strategic_partners ADD COLUMN demo_count INTEGER;
```
