Okay, so I just did a whole one and I'm going to do it again.
Okay, the Power 100 Experience at events summarized.
The Power 100 Experience will begin. We will fill out we will pre-fill all attendees with name, company name, etc., phone numbers, all that fun stuff. However, upon check in, they will get a text message from their AI concierge from the TPX experience. Power 100 Experience is known as the TPX. And
on that first text message will be a greeting by name, by company, and a summary of what we're here to do. Very short. Then from there, we ask them to respond and save our contact information. This way our messages will get through to them and they're not spammed.
The following step will be once they respond and say, okay, cool, got it. Then we'll send them a link to complete the Power 100 experience. The Power 100 experience completion process should already have their name and company name pre-filled things like that. However, we want to leave blank the contact information such as email and phone number because a lot of times when guys register for these events, they don't put their real emails. They put a spam email in there. This way they don't get hit back and forth on sales on sales material. They do the same thing with their phone number.
So what we want to do is have them actually fill out a blank in a blank piece of information for their contact information.
Then from there, um once they complete the experience, we will now have their three primary focus areas as well as their tech stack. And then we need to use our Power 100 experience algorithms in order to optimize this process at the show. And so we want to now customize the show in order for them to get the most out of the event and the money and time spent. So from their completion, we will summarize the top three keynote speakers or sessions that they should attend based on their focus areas, as well as the top three partners or sponsors that are at the event
and who specifically by name they should go talk to at those um at those events.
So the sponsors will be paired with them based off of their matches from the experience and their focus areas, right?
Now, we also want to obtain PCR or Power 100 confidence rating scores, PCR, percentage on all speakers at the keynote sessions.
This is going to be valuable because we need to track all keynote speakers from all events that we do because we want to put out a most impactful um list of speakers at the end of the year.
These events most often are on time and they tend to be very precise with their timeline. However, sometimes an event might get delayed 15 minutes or so. I would love to see an override where me, Greg Cummings, the CEO of the company, I will be at the events, can alter the timeline that is positioned upon onboarding, meaning,
meaning if the event is running 15 minutes behind or a speaker is going longer than usual or longer than recommended, I can text a master override system, my concierge, I can text it and say, hey, you know, XYZ speaker is running over, delay the messaging by 10 minutes. And then it can delay all triggered messaging um by 10 minutes based on just that one or I could, it could ask me clarifying questions if it wants to do the whole show, whatever it is, it can ask me the right questions in order for us to get on on the time frame.
So that's uh the update here for the Power 100 Experience at events. Um we need to uh if you have any questions, let me know. Peace.

Okay, so on events when I'm talking to people, this is what they are expecting. This is what I'm kind of expecting or talking about, I guess. Maybe I should curb my expectations, but here we go. So, a, we either register them because we have enough information on the contractors or they register themselves as they come into the event. They get a text message. So as soon as they register, bank, a text message gets shot, or we just shoot a blank, you know, we fire a text message across to everybody at a certain time. Um and that might be a good time if I get on stage where if I'm on stage at 8:30, you know, we send it exactly at 8:40 and I'm watching the clock and I'm saying, okay, and I can kind of do a countdown, everyone's going to get a text message right now. You know what I mean? If you didn't get it, it's probably a service issue, um because we're in a conference room, whatever the case may be.
Um but what has to happen beforehand is one, we need the registry list, right? We need their cell phone number, we need all that stuff. So there's a pre-register that we're going to work with the event on. Um then on top of that, we need to work with the event on having all of the sponsors that are at the show, 100% registered well before the event. Um that's going to be something that we are going to have to create an outreach campaign to make sure that these guys are getting completed. Um alternatively, you know, we can complete them for the majority of the part on an assumptive base. and I think this is how we have to do it. Say, hey, we filled out your profile, verify it and make any changes that are necessary. I think we'll have a higher engagement rate if we do it that way. And then it's going to give us all this access to these sponsors um and speakers throughout the um throughout the show. So another thing that it needs to kind of do is on the speaker front, um this is either on the speaker front or the agenda front. Either way, I don't know exactly how to do it, but I think either way, the speakers are going to be worked into the agenda. Uh but the speakers have to, you have to get a text message that A, this speaker is pertinent to your focus area and B, you know, give us some feedback on what you thought about that, right? Um and that needs to be a link to say, hey, grade the speaker live. and then it's got to let them know that everything that we do is confidential. I'll obviously let them know that as well that we're not going to share any data or information with the event or party or um anything to do with it. We want to gauge. Our mission is to be a completely unbiased platform that makes sure that the best content, most efficient, most effective and um content is put in front of the contractors so they can improve their business.
Um and then from there,
um the text messages have to go back and forth just like a coach or AI or just like it would be me, right? Saying, hey, look, we got Engage. Um they are a sponsor. Their their's these are the two guys that are registered to work the booth. You have Dean, he's the CEO and you have, you know, Patrick, he's the chief sales officer officer there. Um go talk to either one of these guys and here's why. Your there needs to be a summary of why to go talk to them at Engage. And the summary should read something like this where it's like, hey, Mr. contractor,
um based on your focus area of greenfield growth, Engage is an excellent um partner for you, strategic partner for you because it allows new and and older and seasoned sales reps to be on the same page, whether it's a new update to the value proposition of the company or they're, you know, embedded in the onboarding process and they're still new and they need to be continued training, right? They need continued training. And so Engage's presentation tool gives them the capabilities to be on the same page and not miss and close and communicate at a higher um efficiency rate as well as ultimately closing at a higher rate. So, that needs to happen and then from there, the system needs to remember that contractor. It also should ask it any qualifying questions that it's it needs to know based off of what's going on. Um but the then it then it'll never end. So the whole idea for the
the AI concierge is not necessarily to deliver them the best content and and and gauge with them there, but most importantly, it's to gain their trust, right? So, in that case where it's engaged, they want to say, hey, look, based on your and then we say, hey, this is what you need to tell them. This way you can have an effective conversation. You should go up to them and say, I'm looking to greenfield growth in a new area and I'm having trouble onboarding and training new people fast enough, as well as we have a lot of updates to our company and I am told that engage can help system systematize our in-home conversations to ensure that our homeowners and prospects are hearing what we want them to hear.

And then from there, we want to get feedback from them, right? Um, you know, did you did you find that it was effective? Um did you book an appointment with them? and did you book a demo with them? Fantastic, good to hear. I will follow up with that. When was that demo booked? I can follow up with you. Whatever the case may be. We don't want it to end. We want it to be inquisitive. We want the system to be curious. We want the system to be passionate about resolving their business issues, right? So then from there, it'll say, okay, the next person to talk to at the next break is this, right? And then it goes along the line of the next one. So we're engaging with them every step of the way. It's creating a custom experience at the event. We are taking all these commercialized events and creating individual events for every single person. and we are also saying that you are now able to build, this is so important, you are now able to build your own personal AI agent that is tied to the only closed loop system LLM, long language model database in the country, right? And so that's what this is, that's what we're building. Um then as far as the, okay, I'm going to stop.

It's incredibly important that every element of an event gets its own summary and PCR breakdown. Essentially, a super fucking cool fancy dashboard for their event. It's going to be overall, it's going to be speaker breakdown, right? Everything needs a PCR. PCR is a Power 100 confidence rating. So all of these things need to get a PCR, everything. Anything that we ask them to do, we need to get that. If we tell them to go to engage and talk to them about their presentation tool, we need a PCR score for engage on that first interaction, right? And so the system is always gauging how receptive, impactful, and in each step of the process. It doesn't always have to be just, hey, click this link to take a a test or to take a feedback survey, right? We need to be able to decipher if it was good through the conversation, right? Assumptively.

Also, they should not be able to partake and get the data until they complete their profile at the event. So if the contractor doesn't complete the profile, then we can't create a custom process for them. Does that make sense? So I'm going to I'm going to emphasize that, you know, on my talk when I speak to them or however we communicate that like, hey, we've we've pre-filled a good amount of your profile out, but we need you to go in and complete the profile. It should take five minutes. And then from there, we're able to customize this entire event for you. So you're not just walking around asking people what they do and hopes that it aligns with what you're looking for. We are actually going to put the right people in front of you. And then also one other thing is I want there to be a um a partner matchup, a buddy matchup, a a a peer matchup, okay? So, if there's 100 people in the room, I want every single person to get paired up. Every CEO or every marketing director to get paired up with another person that is their same their same um title, job title,
but in a different market, geographically. I want so I want a window company with a window company, but one on the East Coast, one on the West Coast, right? Or one across town, one the other side of town. And so we want to then link them up on a on a peer meeting, right? Or be able to say, hey, you know, go meet, this is the person that you need to find um at the show and we can say, hey, meet your peer, you know, today, you know right now, like I can say at the next break, you know, find your peer, whatever the case may be. I think that would be really cool. And then we can share their phone numbers and emails with each other.
