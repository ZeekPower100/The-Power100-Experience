# Partner Introduction & Booking Orchestration System

## Overview
The Partner Introduction & Booking Orchestration System is the critical bridge between contractor-partner matching and actual business outcomes. This system ensures that introductions convert to booked demos, demos happen, and outcomes are tracked to continuously improve the platform.

## Core Philosophy
**"We don't just make introductions - we ensure connections happen."**

The system is designed to maintain complete control and visibility over the contractor-partner handoff, ensuring maximum value delivery for all parties while building a data-driven feedback loop that improves future matches.

## System Architecture

### The Value Loop
```
Contractor Match → Email Introduction → Booking Orchestration → Demo Occurs
         ↓                                                            ↓
    AI Learning ← PowerConfidence Update ← Outcome Tracking ← Success Metrics
```

## Current Implementation Status

## Technical Implementation Details

### Email Orchestration Flow
1. **Trigger**: Contractor selects partner from match results
2. **Introduction Email**:
   - TO: partner@subdomain.power100.io
   - CC: contractor email
   - BCC: admin@power100.io (for tracking)
3. **Tracking**: Email open/click tracking via SendGrid
4. **Follow-up Logic**:
   - No response in 24hrs → Automated reminder
   - No response in 48hrs → Admin notification
   - No response in 72hrs → Alternative partner suggested

### Subdomain Configuration
Each partner receives a unique subdomain that:
- Routes emails to their preferred inbox
- Tracks all communications
- Enables branded experience
- Provides analytics dashboard access

Example: `destination-motivation.power100.io`

### Booking Confirmation Workflow
1. Partner responds with proposed times
2. System sends contractor availability request
3. Contractor confirms preferred time
4. System sends calendar invites to both parties
5. Confirmation tracked in database
6. Reminder sent 24hrs before demo
