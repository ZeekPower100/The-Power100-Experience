Okay, so once they're at the event, they go through, they get the recommendations for the three partners, the three, um, the three, you know, things they should attend, as well as their peer match. 

Um, that's something that is important as well as then every step of the way, you know, kind of deciphering what that PCR is for for each thing. 

Um, but then after the event, you know, we also want to encourage them to take notes in this. This is a big part of it. Really, really encourage them to take notes in this, um, and only notes in this. 

Um, in the text message thread, right? And so that's going to do a number of things. One, it's going to tell us what is important to them. So whether they meet somebody and they put down the name of that person and their phone number, um, and their email, just put it there and then boom, we can connect that later. Um, or it's in the middle of a session and he hears something that he likes, he can take that note down. And TPX, the experience should actually know what session they are in, right? Or if they see a note come through, "Perfect, I'll make note of that. By the way, what session are you in this session?" ...? "Yes, I am." "Okay, perfect. Just making sure I'm aligning this up." 

And so it's able to kind of just really engage with them. 

Um, and then after the event, it should summarize it where, "Hey, here's your summary. I can I can I can keep it here for you to read or would you like me to email you the summary?" Right? And then, um, boom, it can email you I could email you the summary or not. Um, or you could say something along the lines of like, "Hey, you know, I have your summary here. Um, you know, would you before I share the summary, what are the main, you know, things that you want to make sure that we do? I can, you know, whatever it is." Maybe you don't do that first. Never mind, scratch that. You send them the summary, point, point, point, point, point. "What are the what are the top three things that you want to make sure that you do here? Or do you want to make sure all of these things get done?" 

And then it can sort of prioritize that for them and then that will kind of create their follow up schedule when TPX, when their AI agent is going to actually then reach out to them to do that. And so it really would be totally killer if if we can get to a point where we are sending that email introduction, like we're able to send an email, you know, from Power 100 to Joey contractor who's using the TPX as well as the introduction to a sponsor, a partner or somebody else that they met at the show. Um, that would be that would be really awesome. 

It would be a way for TPX to really be constantly visual, but I don't know if that's possible. Um, if it's not possible, it can say, "Yep, here is his email. You know, is now a good time to email him?" Like whatever on on Monday. You could text him, be like, "Hey," and then the email is clickable, right? Where then you click the email, it's a hyper link, it takes you to your email where you can just email him. 

Um, it could even be something like, you know, "Here's his email and here's a draft of what it would be." And then, you know, the the TPX agent, the concierge agent would be able to draft up an email. "Hey, it's great to meet you," and it knows what day because that's the day that you put it in. You know, it could just kind of add a couple familiarities that, you know, you probably wouldn't do if if you didn't have this, um, this tool. So, all that's very cool. And then on top of that, right, we want to make sure that we're facilitating the the different partners that they wanted to engage with. Also, um, you know, once they kind of get through their checklist from the event, I think they need to take almost a new TPX or a revised version of it. This way they can then get through it to see what partners are recommended that were not at the events. Because that's a whole another thing is, you know, maybe the best partner for them wasn't at that event, but we have them as a as a client. So we want to make sure that we're pushing them, um, to them. Or maybe it's through conversation. "Hey, I saw your focus area was increasing sales. Um, you know, there was a couple people at the event, but there's also, there's also this company here that's incredible that's very highly rated that you might want to consider because of X, Y, and Z. Right? Click the link here to go to their their TPX landing page and and view more about them." Something like that. So there's just this is like a never ending thing. But the one thing I want to make sure that we do is, um, our sponsors, I'm selling this two ways. One, I want to maximize the time at the events, but number two, this is also an option for companies that don't go to events or are fed up with events or that don't want to do it anymore. This is an option for them to still stay in front of those clients or those prospects. So I'm selling it both ways. Like, "Hey, you you're tired of going to the shows? Well, this is going to be a show that's in their pocket 24/7 365." So the concierge is constantly has to be, you know, figuring this out and recommending tools, but not at a pace that's a salesy pace. It's got to be at a pace that's, you know, uh, received well. Okay, that's long enough.
