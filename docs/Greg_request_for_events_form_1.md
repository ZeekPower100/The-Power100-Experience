Then their AI Conceirge will create a custom Experiance based on their focus areas.  For example, it will summarize the show from their perspective- based on their focus areas it will tell them why it’s important to listen to certain speakers… maybe max it at 3, “top 3” to pay close attention to. Then it will suggest what sponsors to speak with at the event - and warm them up with the questions to ask the sponsor. 

Throughout the event their concierge will text them about the event, speakers and sponsors.
