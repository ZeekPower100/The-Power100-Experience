# AI Coaching System Architecture

## üéØ System Overview

The AI Coaching System is a feedback-gated intelligent assistant that provides contractors with personalized business growth insights based on verified partner performance data and industry intelligence.

## üîê Access Control System

### Feedback Completion Requirement
- **Access Gate**: Must complete quarterly feedback to unlock AI coaching
- **Verification**: System checks feedback completion status before granting access
- **Renewal**: Access requires ongoing quarterly feedback participation
- **Grace Period**: 30-day grace period after feedback due date

### Implementation:
```javascript
const checkAICoachingAccess = (contractorId) => {
  const lastFeedbackDate = getLastFeedbackCompletion(contractorId);
  const currentQuarter = getCurrentQuarter();
  const requiredFeedbackDate = getQuarterStartDate(currentQuarter);
  
  return lastFeedbackDate >= requiredFeedbackDate;
};
```
