All right. So here's how it goes. Uh, it's what I'm thinking for destination motivation, brother. So we need to establish the onboarding form and get that completed. It needs to be completed with company information, um, uploaded with demos, um, also customer information, as well as employee information. And so we can obviously make that up for right now. Um, Meaning we can put in actual company names or whatever, or just say company 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, just so we know it's needs to be replaced later. Um, as well as employee 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, as well as demo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Uh, but I think we need to then complete that onboarding where it's their value proposition, uh, the summary of what it is, the breakdown of their product. Um, but then ultimately, once we get everything back, from the completed, um, power cards, okay, once we get those back, then we'll be able to continue to build their profile. So the first step is the onboarding completed. Then from there, I'm thinking we need to create power cards, like, and so the three key metrics that destination motivation operates on is sale, is closing percentage, cancellation rate, and customer experience. So we need to have questions to send on the power cards to their clients, the contractors, around those three statistics. And we do need to actually get those quarterly averages, okay? Um, so that's very important. Um, And then from there, I think it should be it should also have on there a not just what are these statistics, but, you know, how do you feel you know, how do you feel, uh, destination motivation has has influenced this number? How do you feel it's influenced this number? How do you feel like it's influenced this number? You know, and sort of on a scale of one to five, right? And then maybe the last case, the last question would be, do you think your number would be like this if you didn't have Do you think your number would be this number if you didn't have destination motivation services? So, like each one of those segments maybe are five questions, let's just say. So 15 total questions on the power cards where they click through it in that nice TPX format. Then from there, it's going to go to the the client power cards. So, again, we're that for that I just talked about was creating the card, then we're going to send the card, okay? Um, that card is going to be Um but we're obviously not going to send the card. So we have to anticipate the results back, I guess. Or we just show the card, and this is what it is we would send to your clients, right? Then from there, it we're going to we need to generate the reports. We need to generate example reports. So there's three reports that will generate each quarter. The first one goes to the contractor. This is going to be probably one of the most they're all important, but the contractor, the reason that one's so important is because it's going to compare other companies in different um revenue categories how they are using how they are using destination motivation. And remember, we don't want to share the actual closing percentages, closing rates or however we're judging the customer experience. What we want to do is judge and report on the variants. The variants meaning the difference between last quarter and this quarter. So if it went up 3% or down 3%, we want to indicate that on the reports, okay? So they I can see how everyone else in my category is performing as well as the category above me. So those are the two most important categories, where I am and and above me. Everyone else, we don't need to see on that contract report. Then the destination motivation executive report is going to be everything. Now, remember, this is all going to be 100% um confidential. So we're not going to say who did what, but everything will be broken down into revenue categories, the same revenue categories that we have on currently on there. So let's just stay with those revenue categories, okay? Uh, and then the third one's going to be the public, the public facing report. So destination motivation report, I didn't really touch on that. The executive report, that's going to go back and more of a feedback loop, like more of a, hey, here is your areas of opportunity and here's what you're doing good. This is what you should focus on. This is what you should maybe a start stop keep model or maybe a good what you're doing great versus what you're doing, um, what you're doing, what what people are wanting. I don't know, something like that, right? So that report needs to go to them with suggestions on coaching them on how to actually be better, as well as that report, I'm sorry, not that one. The report to the contractor has to have best practices that is instilled from destination motivation. So, the the contractor report has to have those best practices on how to get optimal results. Then the last report, we're going to jump to the public report. This is ultimately the landing page, right? This is ultimately their PCR, their power confidence rating, their score and then why their PCR score is what it is. And that will that will be a report that is kicked ultimately like what kind of like what we do with our landing pages, but it'll be just a report that can be generated. Okay, I hope this um works. And then finally, the last piece will be marketing. Um, that's where we go back through the TPE or TPX, whatever we're calling it. Um and we show how we market it at the end of the day at the end of the uh session. We'll also show like this is where we're they they're going to take the TPX experience. Okay, they're going to take the TPX as if they were a contractor. And obviously we want them to see destination motivation. Once they land through this, we want them to be able to see the full report, right? That we just talked about. We want them to see the videos, we want them to see our evaluation. We want them to see why their PCR score is a 99, okay? So, um that's kind of where my head's at with it. All right, brother.
