Excellent. This is a classic and very solvable error that happens when you move code from one framework or project setup to another.

The error page is actually pointing out **two separate problems** in your `src/app/layout.tsx` file. Let's fix them one by one.

---

### **Problem 1: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/utils'`**

This is the main error. Your old project used a shortcut path called an "alias" (`@/`) to import files. Your new Next.js project understands this alias, but it can't find the `utils` file because we haven't created it yet.

**The Fix:** We will create the utility file in the correct location (`src/lib`) and update the import statement.

1.  **Create the file:** In the file explorer on the left, right-click on your `src/lib` folder and select "New File". Name it **`utils.ts`**.
2.  **Add content to `utils.ts`:** You will need to move the `createPageUrl` function from your old project into this new file. For now, you can just put some placeholder code in `src/lib/utils.ts`:
    ```typescript
    // src/lib/utils.ts
    export const createPageUrl = (path: string) => {
      // Logic for creating a page URL will go here
      return path;
    };
    ```
3.  **Update the import:** In your `src/app/layout.tsx` file, change line 3 to import from the correct location:
    *   **Change this:** `import { createPageUrl } from "@/utils";`
    *   **To this:** `import { createPageUrl } from "@/lib/utils";`

### **Problem 2: Incorrect Routing Library**

The second, hidden error is on line 2: `import { Link, useLocation } from "react-router-dom";`

**Next.js does not use `react-router-dom`**. It has its own, more powerful built-in routing system. Using `react-router-dom` will break your application.

**The Fix:** We need to replace these imports with the correct Next.js equivalents.

1.  **Delete the incorrect import:** Remove line 2 entirely.
2.  **Add the correct Next.js imports:** Next.js uses `next/link` for navigation and `next/navigation` for hooks that read the current URL. You will add these as needed.

### **Your Corrected `layout.tsx` File**

Here is what the top of your `src/app/layout.tsx` file should look like after making all the changes. You can copy and paste this to fix the errors.

```typescript
// src/app/layout.tsx

import React from 'react';
// DELETED: import { Link, useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import { createPageUrl } from '@/lib/utils'; // <-- FIXED IMPORT PATH
import { Crown, Users, Calendar, BarChart3, Settings } from "lucide-react";

// You'll likely need these Next.js hooks later to replace useLocation
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'; 
// You'll use this component for navigation instead of the one from react-router-dom
import Link from 'next/link'; 

export default function Layout({ children, currentPageName }) {
  // ... rest of your layout code
}
```

After you have saved these changes, go back to your terminal and run `npm run dev` again. The build error should now be gone.
