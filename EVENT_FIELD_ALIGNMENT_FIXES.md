# Event Form Field Alignment Fixes
**Date**: 2025-09-10
**Purpose**: Document all field value mismatches found and fixed between public and admin Event forms

## Summary
Fixed critical value mismatches between the public EventOnboardingForm and admin EventForm that were preventing data from displaying correctly in the admin dashboard.

## Mismatches Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ EVENT_TYPE Field
**Problem**: Value case mismatch
- **Public Form (Before)**: lowercase values ('conference', 'workshop', 'seminar')
- **Admin Form**: Capitalized values ('Conference', 'Workshop', 'Seminar')
- **Fix Applied**: Updated public form to use Capitalized values matching admin form
- **Location**: `EventOnboardingForm.tsx` lines 49-59

### 2. ✅ FORMAT Field  
**Problem**: Value format mismatch
- **Public Form (Before)**: snake_case values ('in_person', 'virtual', 'hybrid')
- **Admin Form**: Capitalized with hyphen ('In-person', 'Virtual', 'Hybrid')
- **Fix Applied**: Updated public form to use 'In-person', 'Virtual', 'Hybrid'
- **Location**: `EventOnboardingForm.tsx` lines 61-65

### 3. ✅ EXPECTED_ATTENDANCE Field
**Problem**: Different input types and data format
- **Public Form (Before)**: Number input field (stored as integer like 0, 250)
- **Admin Form**: Select dropdown with ranges ('1-50', '51-100', '101-250', '251-500', '500+')
- **Database**: Stores as VARCHAR, expects string values like '250+'
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Changed from number input to select dropdown
  - Added EXPECTED_ATTENDANCE_OPTIONS constant with same ranges as admin
  - Updated formData to use string instead of number
- **Location**: `EventOnboardingForm.tsx` lines 67-73 (constants), line 102 (formData), lines 465-479 (input field)

## Fields Verified as Correct
The following fields were checked and found to be properly aligned:
- ✅ **price_range**: Text input in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **organizer_name**: Text input in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **organizer_email**: Email input in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **organizer_phone**: Text input in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **organizer_company**: Text input in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **website**: Text input in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **description**: Textarea in both forms (correct)
- ✅ **location**: Text input in both forms (correct)

## Testing Checklist
After these fixes, verify:
- [ ] Event type selections save and display correctly in admin
- [ ] Event format selections save and display correctly in admin
- [ ] Expected attendance ranges save and display correctly in admin
- [ ] All other fields continue to work as expected

## Impact
These fixes ensure that:
1. Data entered in public forms displays correctly in admin views
2. Admin users can see the correct selections when editing events
3. No data loss or corruption occurs due to value mismatches
4. Consistent user experience across public and admin interfaces

## Database Compatibility
All changes maintain compatibility with existing database schema:
- event_type: VARCHAR(50) - Capitalized values fit
- format: VARCHAR(50) - Capitalized values fit  
- expected_attendees: VARCHAR(100) - Range strings fit

## Next Steps
1. Test all three fixed fields end-to-end
2. Apply similar alignment checks to Book and Podcast forms
3. Consider creating a shared constants file for dropdown options used in both public and admin forms
